<h2 class='nobreak'>1</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the afternoon of the fifth day of November, 1914,
Edward Carroll was sitting as usual in his pleasant inner
office, the windows of which looked down upon the middle-western
city where Mr. Carroll had lived for forty of his
fifty-six years. But he was not behaving quite as usual. At
this hour he should normally have been conferring with other
men upon matters of importance—matters concerning the
cement works of which he was vice-president, or the bank
of which he was a director, or the copper mines whose
policy he principally determined. Or he should, at the very
least, have been dictating replies to half a dozen important
letters that had been placed on his desk while he was out
at luncheon. Instead, Mr. Carroll merely sat in his chair
and stared oddly at a calendar on the wall opposite, as
though its large black announcement of the date had some
deep significance for him, as perhaps it had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he shook his head impatiently and with a quick
gesture pressed a button in his desk. Almost at once his
stenographer entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth,” said Mr. Carroll, “did you tell me a little while
ago that some one was waiting to see me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint surprise showed in the young woman’s composed
face, but she answered the question quietly. “Yes, sir.
Mr. Barnett and Mr. King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they’ll have to wait a little or come some other
time. I must see Stacey first. He telephoned that he’d be
here at three o’clock. It’s three-five now,” Mr. Carroll observed,
drawing out his watch; which was quite unnecessary,
since on the table before his eyes stood a small, perfectly
regulated clock encased in thick curved glass that magnified
its hands and characters conveniently. “When he
comes send him in at once,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the stenographer had scarcely left the room when
the door was opened again and Stacey appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a tall, handsome, well-built, young man, with
blue eyes, short brown hair, and a clear healthy complexion
from which the summer tan had even yet not quite faded.
He looked, and was, well-bred and well educated, but there
was nothing unusual or distinguished in any of his features,
except perhaps in his mouth, which was finely modelled
and sensitive without being self-conscious. The only thing
at all out of the common about him was the impression he
gave of restless but happy eagerness, of being fresh and
untired and curious. He appeared about twenty-six or
seven years old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Stacey,” said Mr. Carroll. “You wanted to
see me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said the young man, and took the chair at
the opposite side of the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief pause while the two gazed across at
each other. Neither could consider the other with cool
detached estimation,—years of familiarity were in the
way; yet Stacey felt dimly that he was nearer to being outside
than he could remember to have been before. He
studied his father’s well-shaped head, with its thick gray
hair, clipped moustache and firm mouth, in something of
the spirit in which, being an architect, he would have
studied a building. He saw his father to-day, quite clearly,
as a man of tremendous, never wasted energy, and with a
warm, generous, unspoiled heart. But it came over Stacey
for the first time that the same directness which made his
father go so unerringly to the point in business matters,
discarding all non-essentials, made him inclined to hold
very positive over-simplified opinions about things in
general. Whereupon, all in this half-minute of silence, it
also occurred to Stacey that business was like mathematics,
founded on definite preassumed principles that you were
always sure of, whereas those—Stacey supposed they were
there—beneath life seemed a trifle wavering and indeterminate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, son, what was it?” asked Mr. Carroll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, father,” Stacey replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man pushed back his chair impatiently, and his
face took on an almost querulous expression that set small
uncharacteristic wrinkles to interfering oddly with its
firm, deeply traced lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose I know what it is,” he said, “but I don’t
see why you should make me state it. You want to go to
the war, and you have an answer ready to every objection I
can make. Damn it all, Stacey! It isn’t our war! If it
becomes so I’ll be the first to say: ‘Enlist!’ but it isn’t—not
yet, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know you think it ought to be, father,” replied the
young man steadily. “I’ve heard you say so a score of
times. Every one with any generosity whom we know
thinks it ought to be. I only want to live up to that conviction.
I believe it’s right against wrong, the—the—soul
against the machine; and so do you, or you wouldn’t have
given so generously to Belgium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father did not seem to be listening. He was staring
away over his son’s head almost dreamily. “I remember
when I built a play-house for you and Julie back of the
stable. You were six years old and tried to carry two-by-fours
to me. You didn’t succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused and looked at his son again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey,” he went on, “I sent you to school and college
for nine years, and then for two years all over Europe, and
then for three years to the Beaux Arts in Paris. It’s taken—how
old are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look it. It’s taken thirty careful years to
educate you. You’re an expensive instrument ready for
use. Are you going to throw all that away to do what
some untrained laborer can do as well—no, better than
you? Are all those years of training going to be to fit
you for no other service than to—to stop a machine-gun
bullet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They ought not to be, father,” said the young man.
“They wouldn’t be in a normal world. They were given
me in a normal world for use in a normal world. But all
of a sudden the normal world has been upset. It’s been
wickedly assailed, wiped out for the moment, by the
greatest crime in history. It’s up to every one of us to
help bring it back. And all over Europe better men than
I, men equally well educated, have given themselves freely—poets,
painters, thinkers,—and trained business-men,” he
added hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it did not for an instant occur to Stacey to
question the justice of his father’s argument. It seemed
to him the only considerable argument against his going
to war, and he again respectfully recognized his father’s
ability to go straight to the essential point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you see, sir,” he said, “that, true as your contention
is for the world as it was—and isn’t, it doesn’t hold
good now. For it would be equally true if America were
in the war, yet then you would, as you said, be the first to
want me to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. America isn’t in the war—yet; but every
single trivial example like mine will help, just a little, to
bring her in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment of silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about me, Stacey?” Mr. Carroll asked at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man gazed at his father sadly. “I know,” he
said. “It’s horrible. But all over the world it’s going on.
The same question’s being asked—and set aside—in
thousands and thousands of families. And—though it
isn’t adequate compensation—you still at least have your
work; which is more than wives and mothers have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Mr. Carroll pushed his chair back sharply. “My
work!” he exclaimed angrily. “Who’s it for? For you,
every bit of it! For you and Julie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, Stacey was young and had a sense of the
ridiculous; so laughter surged up within him now and,
though he kept it silent, relieved his tensity. For he was
earning a respectable salary from the firm of architects
in which he would soon have a junior partnership, and his
father had long since given him two-hundred-thousand
dollars’ worth of excellent municipal and industrial bonds,
some bearing five, some five-and-a-half per cent.; while, as
for his sister Julie, she not only had a strictly equal private
fortune, but was also comfortably married to a prosperous
young lawyer. But, knowing his father, and knowing him
better than usual to-day, Stacey carefully kept his amusement
to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It vanished anyway when his father added: “And
Marian?”—and Stacey winced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t told her yet. I’m going to tell her to-night,”
he said, a little hoarsely. “It’ll almost break her heart, I’m
afraid. All the Marians in the world are having their
hearts broken to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all the fathers and mothers. I could pretty nearly
say: ‘Thank God your mother is not living!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded grave assent. “The individual’s gone by
the board.” After which silence fell upon both men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the older man drew himself together. “What
army?” he asked. “The French?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I thought of that, since I speak French decently,”
said his son briskly, glad of the change in mood. “But I
rather think—though I’m not sure—that I’d have to join
the Foreign Legion there. And sacrifice is all very well,
you know, but it needn’t be suicide. I mean to come back
alive if I can do so honorably. And of course I’ve thought
of the Canadian army. But there’s too much neighborly
dislike between Canadians and Americans. So I’m going
into the English army, if they’ll take me. I’ve a lot of
friends in England, you know. I’ve visited some of them
at their homes. They’ll all be in as officers. Perhaps I
can get into some regiment where I’ll be under one of
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you leave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next Wednesday. I’ll catch the ‘Mauretania.’ Don’t be
angry with me, sir,” he begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father shook his head. “No,” he replied dully, “I
suppose as a matter of fact I’d have done the same thing
at your age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the kindest thing you could say to me,” said the
young man, with a deep sigh of relief. He rose. “I mustn’t
keep you any longer now. The office is full of people waiting
to see you. I say, dad, to-night I—I must go to see
Marian, but to-morrow night let’s dine at the club together
and have champagne and then go to a show and be awfully
gay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shook hands, and Stacey departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the door had closed behind him Mr. Carroll
did not at once summon his stenographer. Instead, he sat
gazing, as before Stacey’s arrival, at the calendar on the
wall opposite. At last he rose, crossed the room, and tore
off the leaf—“Nov. 5.” He folded the paper once across
and placed it carefully in his pocket-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he returned to his chair and pressed the button in
his desk.</p>

<h2>2</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey Carroll was not more unusual than most men,
but he was as much so. The only difference was that his
diversity had been fostered by his education, and that he
was not ashamed of it, but clung to it as something of
value, desiring only to suppress the appearance of it. He
was healthy and vigorous mentally as well as physically,
mixed easily with his fellows, and was as usual on the surface
as were they—on the surface. But really he was unusual
in being extraordinarily sensitive to impressions, to
whatever was beautiful (provided it was also faintly exotic)—in
short, to whatever was fine and delicate and fanciful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if one asks how it came about that, with this characteristic,
he was content to live in the city of Vernon, which
had two hundred thousand inhabitants, was situated in
Illinois, was not very beautiful, and certainly had no touch
of the exotic about it, the answer is that he was not—with
this part of him. The part was not by any means the
whole. With a great deal of the rest of him Stacey very
much liked living in Vernon. He liked many Vernon
people, he liked the physical comforts of his existence, and
he did not dislike being a member of one of the city’s most
prominent families. He had a great capacity for liking both
people and things. He could perceive bad in them, but
quite instinctively his mind singled out and dwelt on the
good. Moreover, it should at once be said for Vernon that
it differed from the average middle-western city of two
hundred thousand inhabitants. Being close to Chicago it
was metropolitan in feeling; plays came to it and music; its
citizens—the ones Stacey knew—were sophisticated, well
informed, almost too up-to-date; the houses that they built—often
with Stacey’s help—were modern and handsome.
The provincial spirit had long since vanished from Vernon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, after all, Stacey’s very eccentricity—his delight in
what was wistful and lovely,—though it would certainly
have been better satisfied in Paris, was not altogether starved
in Vernon, as a love of classic line might have been. Books
and music fed it; and where in the whole world could he
have found more perfect satisfaction of it than in Marian
Latimer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the three years that he had known her, to enter the
door of the house in which she and her parents lived had
been to him like crossing the threshold of fairy-land. Outside
there might be street-cars and motors and the smell of
soft coal; within there was charm and grace and peace—not
stupid peace, tingling peace—and Marian, who embodied
them all, with so much more, and spread them about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never until this evening had Stacey entered the Latimer
house without experiencing a sudden sense of buoyancy.
But to-night his heart was so heavy that it seemed to weigh
his whole body down. He had a curious feeling that he
must tread carefully or he would break something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the narrow Colonial hallway he gave his coat and hat
to the maid, then went into the drawing-room, which was
white and spacious, though the house was small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Latimer were there; Marian was not.
Marian was never there. She was always coming from
somewhere else or going somewhere else—both in space
and time. At least, that was the impression she left lovingly
in Stacey. Not that she was full of futile restlessness. It
was only that her charm was the charm of movement, of
running water, of a humming-bird. Mentally as well as
physically—oh, far more!—she paused only at moments
in her flittings. You hardly ever caught her. But that
made the rare moment more precious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her parents greeted Stacey with quiet cordiality and
made him sit down beside them in front of the open fire
that, in the semi-darkness of the room, set reflections glowing
here and there across the yellow of polished brass and
the cool rich surface of statuettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marian will be down soon, I’ve no doubt,” said her
father, with a low laugh at having said it so many times
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey considered him, feeling much the same appreciation
he felt for Marian—only without the thrill and the
sense of enchantment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, indeed, Mr. Latimer deserved appreciation. He was
slim and straight, and his head was the head of a Greek
youth grown old. Curly white hair, straight nose, short
upper lip,—nothing was wrong. His profile, at which Stacey
gazed now, was clear and perfect, like Marian’s. Until
three years ago Mr. Latimer had lived, with his wife and
daughter, his books, his pictures, and his Chinese vases, in
Italy; and certainly a Florentine villa seemed the properer
setting. For the life of him Stacey could not understand
why the Latimers should have returned to live in America,
and of all places in America should have chosen Vernon,
Illinois, even if it was Mr. Latimer’s birthplace. But Stacey
was devoutly grateful that they had done so. He rather
thought it was due to Mrs. Latimer, and he was glad to
think so, since it gave him something to like her for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer, in fact, worried Stacey a little, because
he could not make her out. She, too, was handsome
in a way, but she seemed to Stacey not to be in the picture,
but aloof, dispassionately commenting on everything and
every one, including himself, her daughter, her husband,
and her husband’s Chinese vases. Stacey recognized honorably
that this was probably only his fancy; for Mrs. Latimer
never passed such comment aloud. She was habitually quiet,
letting others talk; but she was certainly not stupid. Sometimes
she would laugh suddenly and spontaneously when
neither Stacey nor Mr. Latimer had seen anything amusing
until her laughter caught them up, and sent them back to
look again, and made them laugh too, always appreciatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re grave to-night, Stacey,” said Mr. Latimer, turning
his eyes to the young man’s face. “I suppose it’s this
catastrophic war. Of course it’s to your credit that you’re
capable of feeling it intensely; the fact reveals a precious
un-American gift of imagination. But you’re wrong, all
the same, to let the thought of the war weigh you down, you
know. I’m increasingly convinced that each man has a
world of his own and that this is the only world in which
he can profitably live. I’m more convinced of it than ever
now when I see painters and philosophers and musicians
dropping their arts and engaging in violent, quite futile polemics
on something outside their own worlds. A painter’s
ideas on, say, the correct method of building a sewer are
without value; so also are his ideas on war. He wastes his
own time and that of others in expressing them. To each
man his own world. To you building noble houses. To
me collecting vases. Also we have properly an outlet for
our emotion there. We have no outlet for emotion concerning
the war. That’s harmful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had listened to the melodious flow of Mr. Latimer’s
words with a faint unaccustomed irritation. He could see
no flaw in the argument; logically Mr. Latimer was right.
Yet, even if uselessly and wastefully, how could one help
abandoning cool logic while the terrible waves of the war
flooded in from every side? Just as that afternoon it had
occurred to Stacey that success in business entailed an over-simplified
view of life, so now it occurred to him that success
in living entailed too neat a perfection. Actually the
two results were not so very far apart. How odd! “Of
course,” he added to himself, “he does not know that I
<span class='it'>have</span> found an outlet for my emotion about the war.” But
Stacey was not going to tell Mr. Latimer of this. He was
going to tell Marian—if she would only come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the ‘<span class='it'>tour d’ivoire</span>’ theory, sir,” he said, after a brief
pause. “I dare say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But fingers brushed his hair and forehead, and his words
ceased abruptly, while his heart gave a bound, and a slow
thrill crept over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marian!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was gone already and smiling at him mischievously
from the arm of her father’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” Stacey said appealingly to Mrs. Latimer,
“if you’d think me very abrupt in asking Marian to go
up to the library with me. There’s something I want to
talk over with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer looked at the young man steadily, for the
first time since his entrance. “No,” she said quietly, “do
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said Marian gaily, “whether Marian is going
to have anything to say about it.” But then, before the
earnestness of Stacey’s expression, she ceased smiling and
led him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upstairs in the library she made him sit down in an
easy chair and perched herself on an ottoman at his feet.
She was admirably quick in responding to moods and she
looked up at Stacey now with a tender gravity. He longed
to stretch out his hand and touch her and draw her to
him. But he knew that if he did so she would slip away
from him to become all motion and fluidity again; so he
merely sat and gazed at her fair curly hair, her eyes, her
small mouth, and the delicate contour of her cheeks, thinking
her like a Tanagra come to life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marian dearest,” he said at last, “I’ve made up my mind
about something—all alone, without asking you first, because
if I’d asked you I’d have made it up wrong, no matter
what you said. Marian, I’m going to the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For just an instant the girl continued to gaze up at him,
clearly not taking it in. Then her face flamed with eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Stacey!” she cried, her eyes shining. “Oh, Stacey!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey’s heart had all at once grown intolerably
heavy with pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true that the very next instant Marian’s mouth
drooped and she cried: “Oh, Stacey!” again in a different
lower tone, and suddenly was in the young man’s arms and
kissing him tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, though Stacey was made dizzy with love, the pain
endured. As long as he lived, he felt, he would remember
that Marian’s first thought had been that he was going to
be a hero; that he was going away from her into that
horrid mess across the Atlantic, perhaps to be killed, only
her second thought. This perception did not develop into
criticism of Marian. Stacey was incapable of criticizing
Marian. She was perfect. It was simply a wound—the
first the war inflicted on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And also he felt dimly that since this morning all the
fine clarity of his life had given place to confusion. His
reaction to everything was hopelessly different. Throughout
the evening Marian was prodigal of her grace, showered
him with impulsive expressions of affection; yet, instead
of sheer loving delight in her, such things stirred him to
physical and mental desire, desire to possess this girl, body
and soul. He flushed with shame. He had never felt this
way before; or, if he had, he had not known it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When at last it was so late that Stacey simply must not
stay longer, Marian accompanied him downstairs, her hand
in his. They looked into the drawing-room so that he might
say good night to her parents, but the room was empty.
Only a single shaded lamp had been left burning, and the
fire on the hearth was flickering to ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose papa’s at the club, and probably mamma has
gone to bed,” said the girl, in the hushed tone that dark and
emptiness induce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awfully late,” he replied remorsefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew away from him to a distant dim corner, from
which her face shone palely like a white flower in the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey,” she called softly, “come here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obeyed, and all at once her slender arms were about
his neck, pulling his head down, her fragrant hair was
against his face, and her lips were pressed to his in such
a willing kiss as she had never given him before. It left
him trembling from head to foot. His heart beat madly.
He could not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she could. “<span class='it'>Now</span> will you forget me, Stacey?” she
murmured, with a low mischievous laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever she felt, it was certainly not what he was
feeling. Well, that was right. He was glad of that—he
supposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hall, however, she did not laugh. “Oh, Stacey,”
she said, “come every day until you go! Come twice a day,
three times! Come all day long!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her fingers and stumbled dizzily out of the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he reached the sidewalk a woman, muffled in a
heavy fur coat, came toward him. “Mrs. Latimer!” he
cried out in surprise, when she was close to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to speak to you alone, Stacey,” she said. “So
when I heard you leave the library I slipped on a coat and
came out here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was genuinely touched, but also apprehensive—as
one always is toward the mother of one’s fiancée—for
fear that she was going to reprove him for something in his
behavior to her daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I’ve kept you a long time!” he stammered.
“Aren’t you cold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey,” said Mrs. Latimer, looking gravely into the
young man’s face, “you’re going to the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you know?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen it coming for many days,” she replied, “and
to-night I was sure. You came to tell Marian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. How very, very good of you to want to speak
to me and to wait for me here outside!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “Come! Let’s walk up and down
for a few minutes,” she said, and took his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Latimer,” he begged, “you’re not going to tell
me that I’m wrong? It’s been so hard for me to decide.
You’re not going to tell me that I owe it to Marian to
stay? It would be so sweet to stay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! Oh, no! no! no!” she replied. Then, after a
pause: “How did Marian take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a dear!” he said loyally, but with a sinking
feeling at his heart. “She has never been so kind to me
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she glad you were going to be a hero?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started. This was uncanny. But he felt resentment,
too. “Marian is so fine,” he said a little stiffly. “She sees
things in flashes. She looks through the—the ugly facts
to the glory beneath them. I’m not a hero—I know it only
too well; but Marian sees only the collective recognition
that I and a thousand others are giving of—of—the existence
of something deeper than facts—of an idea.” He
shook his head, unable to express his thought, and uneasily
conscious that he was defending Marian—not very well,
either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy,” Mrs. Latimer returned, “please believe
that I am not blaming Marian for anything. I recognize
as clearly as you do all her fineness. Marian lives in
a palace. And when you live properly in a palace, perfectly
at home there, you have palatial thoughts. But, you
see, I don’t live in a palace. I’m of coarser clay. You
don’t know me very well, Stacey, but I know you, I think.
And I felt I must see you for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was moved by her kindness and murmured his gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t really know,” she went on, “what it is I
want to say. Nothing, perhaps. Certainly nothing that is
clear. The world is a welter of confusion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded assent, feeling closely and comfortingly
drawn to this middle-aged woman who had always seemed
aloof to him before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer did not speak again for several minutes.
“How do I know what war does?” she continued at last.
“How should you know, for that matter? But, Stacey,
if it changes you in odd deep ways that you can’t conceive
of now—nor I, either—don’t, please don’t, suffer too much
and blame yourself for the changes. There’ll be so much
suffering you’ll have to go through anyway that it would
be a pity to add to it unnecessarily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I don’t think I understand, Mrs.
Latimer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How in the world should you?” she replied. “I don’t,
either. I only feel something rather vaguely. But there
is one thing clear, my dear boy. I want you to be certain
that you have a sincere affectionate friend in me, who will
always try her puzzled best to understand you sympathetically.
And that was really all I had to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you!” he cried, genuinely touched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now take me home,” she added. “We must go carefully
around the house and I’ll let myself in at the back
door so that Marian won’t know I’ve been out.” She
laughed. “Think of your having an assignation with your
mother-in-law and having to conceal it from her daughter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Stacey had seen Mrs. Latimer safely enter the
back door of her house, and was walking home along the
deserted streets, though he felt warmed and comforted
by her unexpected intelligent friendship, he also felt an
uneasy sense of disloyalty, as though he and she had become
accomplices in a secret league against Marian.</p>

<h2>3</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey arrived in New York one afternoon about a week
later. His boat was to sail the next morning. He went to
the small hotel on Tenth Street where he always stayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Mr. Carroll? Glad to see you, sir,” said
the clerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey wasted no time, but dropped his suitcase in his
room and set off immediately up-town on the top of a
motor-bus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was clear dry weather, not too cold, and the city’s
buildings stood out sharply against a brilliant sky. Stacey
had never liked this glittering hardness in the atmosphere
of New York. The Metropolitan Tower wouldn’t be so
bad and the Woolworth would be bully, he had often
thought, if only they would soar up dimly into a softening
haze, as they would in Paris. The whole show was good,
but not good enough to stand this crude vivid light.
Nothing could stand it—neither façades nor human faces.
It was like an immense close-up at the movies. And to-day,
since he continued to feel about him and within himself
so much confusion, this effect of physical clarity really
made him uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the discomfort soon faded and he thought only that
he was to have this whole afternoon and evening with
Philip Blair. He took the stuffy elevator in the Harlem
apartment house, stepped out, and hurried down the dark
hall to Philip’s door with no other feeling than gladness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip himself opened the door, and his face showed as
warm a pleasure as his guest’s. He was thin and slight almost
to emaciation, with keen prominent blue eyes, a sharp-cut
nose whose nostrils seemed to sniff like a dog’s, and a
short fair moustache. He looked like a medieval ascetic,
superficially modernized. Just at present he was in shirt-sleeves
and held a pair of compasses in one hand. With
the other he shook Stacey’s eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, I’m glad to see you!” he cried. “But why do
you give me only a day? Why didn’t you come and stay a
week? Come on in!” And he led Stacey down a narrow
hall and through the dining-room into his study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t do it,” Stacey replied on the way. “Whole
business so sudden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so,” the other assented quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you working on?” asked Stacey, leaning over the
drawing-board in the study and fumbling abstractedly at
the same time with a pile of sketches that lay, curled up
anyhow, on a table close-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Public library for a village,” said Blair, pulling a sketch
of the front elevation from the rattling heap of papers,
spreading it out on the board, and holding it down flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together they leaned over it. Stacey nodded. “Fine!”
he said. “Awfully good! Let’s see. It’s not for a New
England village. Where is it for? Pennsylvania?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty near. Western New York, close to the Pennsylvania
line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey continued to examine the drawing, then began to
smile, poked his finger at it with a wide curving gesture,
and finally broke into a frank laugh. “Always the same
old Phil!” he said gaily, dropping into an easy chair.
“Quite incorrigible! Don’t you ever remember how many
shameful ‘<span class='it'>Hors Concours</span>’ you were always getting at the
Beaux Arts, and how disapprovingly old Fromelles used
to shake his head over your <span class='it'>projets</span>, and what they all used
to think of you: ‘Too bad! Just a little vulgar! Just a
little vulgar!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blair laughed with him, but after a moment Stacey became
suddenly silent and gazed with a puzzled frown at his
friend, wondering how it was that any one so physically
frail as Blair could possess such creative masculine vigor of
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you getting on, Phil?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blair shrugged his shoulders. “Oh, all right enough,” he
answered lightly. “I scrape along without too much difficulty.
It would be easier in one way if I were to go in with
some firm, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never do—for you, never in the world!” Stacey interrupted,
shaking his head. “You’d feel crushed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’d rather go it on my own. I’m all right. Absolutely
the only thing that bothers me is not getting enough
jobs. I don’t mean because I need them financially, but
because—you know how it is—to learn, a man has to see
his work in actual stone and brick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re too damned good!” said Stacey hotly. “You’ve
got the real stuff in you. Here am I, prospering like a—like
a pork packer, while you struggle along unappreciated;
yet you’re a thousand times better than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re too generous and loyal, Stacey,” Blair returned,
with a shake of his fair head. “I couldn’t ever reach your
delicacy in detail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Detail, yes,” Stacey muttered. “I—” He, too, shook
his head, while his friend gazed at him with a calm clear
smile. “Lack of vulgarity is the curse of more places
than the Beaux Arts,” Stacey concluded suddenly. “There’s
a brand-new thought for you—brand-new so far as I’m concerned.
Make what you can of it, Phil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Blair laughed. “Sounds interesting,” he said. “I’ll
have to think it over. Anyhow, you needn’t worry about
me. I manage to scrape enough together to live and keep
Catherine and the boys going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the kiddies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out for a walk with her. They’ll be in soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this a silence, that perhaps both young men had felt
lying in wait, descended upon them. Blair was the first to
meet frankly what it stood for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re going over into it, Stacey,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded. “I’ve got to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Blair slowly, after another pause, “I suppose,
in view of the tremendous issue, I ought to feel principally
gladness that one bit more of strength and courage
is thrown into the right side of the balance. But, do you
know, I don’t—I can’t. Perhaps it’s because I’m not big
enough to get away from personal feelings. And yet I
don’t think it’s merely that. The truth is, Stacey, that you
and I are individualists. We were born like that and we’ve
been brought up that way. The profession we’ve chosen is
individualistic—not perfectly so, because we have to meet
the ideas of our clients; but a good deal so, all the same.
For the very fact that people in general are so standardized,
unindividual, wanting in ideas of their own, makes them
leave pretty much in our hands the houses they hire us to
build for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was smiling. He recognized with affectionate
amusement a characteristic of his friend’s mind—that inability
to leave any side issue of a theme unexplored before
pursuing the main theme onward. How different from
Stacey’s father! And also how honest and thorough!
Most people thought that Philip had a wandering mind. He
knew better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Philip always did come back to the theme. He was
back in it now. “We’re against the current,” he was saying
sadly. “The whole trend of the world is overwhelmingly
toward collectivism, doing and feeling in common, standardization.
And yet—and yet—the unit <span class='it'>is</span> the individual;
it can’t ever be the group. The individual’s a fact. There
you have him, complete, a world—his only one—to himself.
The group’s a fiction, a composite photograph, lifeless. Oh,
I <span class='it'>know</span> the whole trend of things is wrong and that we’re
right—so long as we harness our individualism and don’t
let it grow into a silly cult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right?—wrong?” he went on musingly, staring off
through the window. “What do I mean by right and
wrong? Well, I mean, I suppose, creatively valuable, creatively
harmful. And the war’s going to rush and swell
the advance of collectivism. No more art, no more thought,
no more real life! Not till long after the war is over.
You’ll see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it was what Stacey himself had told his father.
But he hadn’t perceived all that it meant. That was what
you got for being impressionistic instead of thorough, he
told himself humbly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blair turned his eyes back slowly to his friend. “And
that,” he concluded, his thin face drawn with an expression
of pain, “is why—though I know you’ve <span class='it'>got</span> to do it, and
though I’d do it too, if I had the bodily health—that is why
I feel, above all, grief that you must throw yourself into
that inferno of awful physical and worse mental suffering.
Forgive me!” he cried remorsefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the shadow that had come over Stacey’s face was not
there because of the prophecy of pain. Stacey was thinking
of the contrast between Philip’s words and Marian’s.
“That’s all right, Phil,” he said quietly. “It wasn’t what
you said that bothered me. It was something else. Of
course I know what I’m going into—so far as one can know
through his imagination about something totally outside his
experience. It’s a great deal better to think of it beforehand
and be ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They dropped all talk of the war after this; and before
long Philip’s sons dashed in. Jack, the younger boy, who
was two-and-a-half, ran at once shyly to his father; but the
older, who was five, gave his hand to Stacey with a pretty
confiding cordiality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Uncle Stacey?” he said, with childish
formality, recently enough learned to demand care and
effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Carter,” returned Stacey, who liked the boy and
liked being called uncle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child leaned against his knee. “Uncle Stacey,” he
exclaimed, his soft eager face glowing, “will you do ‘Fly
away, Jack! Fly away, Jill!’ for me? I think I can find
them this time. I think I know where they went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Blair laughed. “Having achieved formality,” he
said, “he puts it behind him at once. ‘Something accomplished,
something done, has earned a night’s repose.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite right, too,” Stacey replied. “I promise I will
after just a little while, Carter. Where’s your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” said Catherine, coming through the doorway. “It
was windy out. I had to fix my hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook hands with Stacey, a little shyly and formally,
almost like her son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go into the sitting-room,” she said, in the abrupt
way she had of speaking. “There’s a pleasant fire in there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they had sat down in front of it they all became
silent—all, that is, save Jack, who, on the floor with his
toys, babbled to himself ceaselessly of a thousand important
things. Even Carter was silent. He sat on a foot-stool
and gazed at Stacey from a little distance with patient
expectancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, however, had forgotten him. A dozen thoughts
were moving through the young man’s mind, yet not turbulently,
but smoothly, without interference, like ships on
a wide river. Perhaps this was because he was not thinking
of himself at all, but of Phil and Catherine. He looked at
Catherine, sitting there across the hearth, she, too, apparently
far away in thought, and tried to study her objectively.
She was tall and dark and handsome, with high cheek-bones,
a high forehead, and black eyes set deep beneath long sweeping
lashes. She had a magnificent figure, lithe, supple and
without opulence—slender, even,—but making evident the
large bony structure. So, too, with her head. It was like
a firm Mantegna drawing, revealing clearly what lay beneath
the smooth close-textured skin. Therefore in repose her
face appeared even stern. There was something sculpturesque
about Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these things were externals. What was she really
like? Stacey could not discover. In all the years that he
had known her, first as Philip’s fiancée and then as Philip’s
wife, he had never got beneath her intense shy reserve. Yet—which
seemed odd—there was no sense of constraint between
them as long as Phil was there, too. Stacey could
talk impersonally with her, or, better still, sit for a long time
silent with her, as now, perfectly at ease and sure that she,
too, felt at ease. That was all, though. He could not understand
the marriage. Still, he recognized that it was a happy
marriage and he admitted loyally that a man very rarely
did understand his most intimate friend’s choice of a wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, he remembered, he had tried to sum up Catherine
and her relation to Phil impressionistically. Once
he had told himself that she was like a castle and Philip
like a wind blowing around it, rattling the shutters but
leaving the castle permanent and unchanged. But he felt
a touch of impatience now in the recollection of that judgment.
He had always been full of such fancies. Perhaps
he had even cultivated them and felt a small pride in them.
Somehow, in these last weeks he had come to feel almost
antipathy for these baubles. What did they really explain?
What good did it do to catch a mood, even truly? What
was a mood but an evanescent unrelated thing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But distaste for oneself does not suffice to alter one’s
nature. Stacey did not perceive that his present musings
had the same quality they disapproved of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Carter who broke the silence—with a plaintive
unconscious sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip laughed, but his visitor started. “Oh, Carter, old
chap,” he said remorsefully, “I forgot all about Jack and
Jill! I’m ready now. Come on over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child ran to him delightedly, all the ages and ages of
tedious waiting forgotten at once; and Stacey took a postage
stamp from his pocket, tore it carefully in half, and gummed
the pieces to the nails of his two forefingers. Experience
had taught him that stamps were safer than scraps of ordinary
paper, which had an embarrassing way of coming off.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Two little black-birds sitting on a hill,</p>
<p class='line0'>One named Jack and one named Jill.</p>
<p class='line0'>Fly away, Jack!—Fly away, Jill!</p>
<p class='line0'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>Come back, Jack!—Come back, Jill!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Stacey performed the magic trick over and over again,
while Carter searched unavailingly for the birds’ hiding-place,
sure that he would find it the next time, and Jack,
not understanding but delighted none the less, trotted
around tirelessly after his brother, and the November twilight
crept in through the windows and darkened the room.
Then it was time for the children to go to bed, and Catherine
led them away, leaving the two men together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while she came back, and they all three went in
to dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey glanced at the table appreciatively. “Phil has one
human foible, anyway,” he said to Catherine. “He never
cared what he ate, but he’s always been fastidious about
how he eats it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine gave him a rare smile, that softened her face
to beauty. “Do you mean,” she asked, “that all the setting
is good, but the dinner itself not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, pleased and surprised at the disappearance of
her shyness. “You know I don’t. How can I tell what the
dinner’s like when everything’s concealed beneath those
heavy silver covers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stayed until very late in the evening. It had always
been Catherine’s way to disappear rather early and leave her
husband and Stacey to themselves, no doubt because she
knew that she had no real part in their intimacy. But to-night,
though she went out of the room from time to time,
she invariably returned. Indeed, she seemed different to
Stacey. It was, he thought, as though one thickness of the
veil between them had been stripped away. (Oh, Stacey!
Dislike of impressionism?). Once he caught her gazing at
him with a melancholy intentness; but, seeing that he was
looking, she turned her eyes away at once and stared into
the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The war was not mentioned; but, because there was no
feverishness in the talk or sense of constraint upon the three,
Stacey felt that this revealed no attempt to evade the war
and his share in it. The war was there and he was going
to it. This was a simple fact, conceded by all three. There
was nothing to do about it or say about it. War was not a
part of their past or woven anyhow into the fabric of their
minds. Not a bit of use for conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be down at the boat to-morrow morning,” Phil said,
when at last Stacey rose to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Phil,” Stacey replied gratefully. “Good night,
Catherine, and thank you both—ever so much. I feel—bathed
in quiet happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine gave him her hand, with a murmured good
night, then dropped it abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shy once again,” thought Stacey with kindly amusement.</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>When the next day all good-byes had been said, and the
great ship was sweeping out to sea, and Stacey was walking
to and fro alone on the deck, with all his thirty years of life
vanishing behind him, rounded out, ended, a completed
story, while between it and his present self a mist began
to rise, like the mist that was rising between ship and shore,
he gathered up the impressions the final week had left him—gently,
as one ties together old letters before putting them
away. And, stripping them down to essentials, he could find
but this:—that there was a sweet serenity in the memory
of the afternoon and evening with the Blairs, an odd sense
of comfort in the picture of Mrs. Latimer stepping towards
him beneath the arc-light in front of her house, and—yes—comfort
again in the thought of Julie—his sister, Julie, with
whom he had never had anything in common save their
relationship, but the vision of whose good-humored face,
stained with tears, and of whose ridiculous efforts to make
her eight-months-old baby say good-bye to Uncle Stacey, recurred
to him now gratefully. In the thought of Marian
there was only uneasy pain. Perhaps, he reflected sadly,
this was just because she had hurt his vanity, or perhaps it
was because at such a moment of leave-taking what one
demanded was merely simple affection, or perhaps it was
because intense love must be uneasy and painful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put the letters away and closed the drawer upon them.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>PART I</span></h1></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny! June is June. Permanent sort of thing. Looks,
in 1919, ridiculously the same as it looked in 1914.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Stacey Carroll reflected idly, as he stepped out into
the fresh dusty sunlight from the pier at the foot of West
Twenty-Third Street. He wore the uniform of a captain of
infantry in the American army, with the red, white and blue
ribbon of the D. S. C.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He summoned a taxi with an imperious but economical
gesture of the wrist and forefinger, spoke two words to
the chauffeur, flung in his bags lightly, and set off for the
small hotel on Tenth Street. During the whole of the brief
ride he looked out of the window, observantly enough, but
he did not appear to be affected one way or another by what
he saw. At any rate his face remained impassive until,
when he had descended from the taxi and entered the
hotel, the clerk at the desk shook his hand and said: “How
do you do, Captain Carroll? Glad to see you safely back,
sir,” Then Stacey smiled in an odd twisted way that did
not make the expression of his mouth more genial or bring
any expression at all into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his room he lighted a cigarette, laid it on an ash-tray,
and set immediately to unpacking his bags, swiftly, systematically
and without haste, pausing only for an occasional
puff at the cigarette. Three minutes before he had
finished unpacking he turned on the water in the bath-tub.
The bath was ready at almost the precise moment Stacey
was ready for it. He dressed with the same smooth uninterested
efficiency he had shown in unpacking and undressing.
Only once did he make any wasteful gesture. This
was when, his foot coming in contact with one of the puttees
he had laid on the floor, he deliberately kicked the puttee
across the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, when he had bathed and dressed and everything
was put away, Stacey looked in the telephone book, then
called up Philip Blair’s number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phil? This is Stacey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, just now, a few minutes ago! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How’s that?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, yes, perfectly sound! No wooden leg, no false
face, nothing at all! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why didn’t I <span class='it'>what</span>? (What the
devil’s come over your telephone system?) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh,
write oftener! Well, I did! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, of course. ’T’s what
I telephoned for. Sure! Be right up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s voice had been cool and almost expressionless,
but his face had softened a little. After he had hung up the
receiver he stood for a moment gazing abstractedly ahead
of him. Then he put on his hat and went out of the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not take a motor-bus. Instead, he set off up
Fifth Avenue on foot, with an easy sauntering gait that
was faster than it looked. It was not at all the way Stacey
had walked in 1914. It was more graceful and fluent, revealing
a perfect, harmonious and unconscious command of
his whole body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he walked, he stared about him restlessly; but nothing
that he saw disturbed the immobility of his face until he
reached the triumphal arch at Madison Square. He gazed at
this for some time with a most unpleasant expression indeed,
then approached it more closely and read the immortal village
names inscribed upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, damn!” he said, and, walking quickly to the nearest
subway station, took a train for Harlem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Same dingy apartment house, looking a little dingier after
five years, same dark elevator, same stuffy hall; and here
came Phil and Catherine running down it to meet him.
Their eagerness touched Stacey. He did not himself feel
eager, though he was glad to see them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” cried Phil. “Well! Now how—now what—I
mean, what <span class='it'>can</span> a fellow say in these circumstances? Come
along! Come on in! Hurry up about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And: “We’re so glad!” said Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They pushed him into their flat, through the dining-room,
into the sitting-room, and plumped him down in an easy
chair. A table stood beside it, with a pitcher and glasses.
Ice tinkled as the table was jostled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sauterne cup,” Phil explained breathlessly. “ ‘Gather
ye rose-buds’ and so forth. Only a short time left, you
know. Sole subject of conversation in our great republic.
Here! Drink! ‘Drink for your altars and your fires!’ I
mean to say: ‘Drink, for once dead you never—’ oh, no,
that isn’t it!” And he broke out laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine was calmer, or anyway more static. She had
sat down on an ottoman, elbows on knees, chin in hands,
and was gazing up at Stacey. But her face, too, glowed
with pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was smiling faintly. He looked from one to the
other and said to himself that they were both just the same
as four and a half years since, for all that Phil looked older
and more worn and even a little thinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re both awfully good to me,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re awfully noisy!” exclaimed Phil remorsefully, sitting
down. “We forget that you’re tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey lit a cigarette. “I’m not tired, Phil,” he remarked.
“I never get tired nowadays. Nothing like military service
for keeping one fit, you know,” he added drily. “And I’m
gladder to see both of you than any other two people in the
world.” He spoke with an effort. “You both all right?
Everything going well? The children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out at their aunt’s house in the country,” replied Philip,
a look of perplexity coming over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly Catherine spoke, haltingly, with the way
she had of being unused to words, but earnestly. “What
does it—do to a man, Stacey? As much as—all that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sighed in relief. “Wipes him out, Catherine,” he replied
in an emotionless voice. “Replaces him with some one
else. Good thing that you saw. Because I couldn’t possibly
keep up the bluff. I can’t pretend with you two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor with any one else,” said Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor with any one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip laughed. “Well, then,” he declared, “we have with
us to-day a brand-new friend!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Catherine was clearly going to have things over and
done with. “You mean,” she said courageously, “that you’re—glad,
a little—to see us, but not—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the way I ought to be. Only in a vague uneasy
dead way. Rotten, isn’t it? And brutal. And bound to
hurt your feelings. But what can you expect? If I were
to see a man cut in two by a bus on the Avenue I shouldn’t
feel anything at all except a little distaste. There you have
it. Pretty, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the truth,” said Catherine, her eyes shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Stacey admitted. “There’s that to be said for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Blair tugged at his short blond moustache and
stared at his friend wistfully. “You don’t hurt me, Stacey,”
he said at last. “And it’s not true that you’re not fond of us.
If it were true you wouldn’t have been so honest. How do
I know what they’ve done to you? You’re all—seared over.
Had to be, I suppose, or die. You’ll come back to us. Now
tell us about all the outside things. First with the English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was with them, first as an N. C. O., then as a lieutenant,
up to June, 1917. Then I transferred to our—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on! Hold on! You got the D. S. O. How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the D. S. O. On the Somme, at Bazentin-le-Grand,
for going out with ten men and cleaning up a machine-gun
nest. I transferred—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it all!” said Phil, “is that the best you can do with
it? How did you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey shook his head impatiently. “And then,” he went
on, “as I said, I transferred to the American army and was
made a captain. And I got the D. S. C. ‘for cool leadership
and conspicuous bravery in action.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden change came over Stacey’s face. It woke, as it
were, to life—but to sinister life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you about <span class='it'>that</span>,” he said in a vibrant passionate
voice. “I got the D. S. C. for carrying out an order that was
sheer murder, for leading my company in a frontal attack
against a perfectly worthless position over ground rotten
with machine-guns. Not half of my men got off clear. A
perfectly worthless position, I tell you, that we retired from
next day because it wasn’t possible to hold and wouldn’t
have done us any good if we could have held it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, there was capacity for emotion left in Stacey,—that
was clear. Any one’s first impression of him would have
been wrong. The question was—capacity for what emotion?
A fierce chill intensity glowed in, or perhaps behind,
his face. It died down as swiftly as it had kindled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a—what a ghastly blunder!” Philip Blair murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what war is,” Stacey replied. “One blunder after
another. The side which makes the most blunders loses.
A trite thought, but true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the Germans made the most?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, by far!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange! For a while they seemed invincible—machine-perfect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey lit a fresh cigarette. “It was the legend they threw
out. They might have won perhaps if they hadn’t grown to
believe in it themselves,” he remarked, almost indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid his cigarette down suddenly and smiled. “Come!”
he said, with a hard cheerfulness, “I’ll tell you about something
pleasant—the reason I’m here only now, the reason I
didn’t get my ‘majority,’ the reason they packed me off to
Italy after the Armistice, the one thing I ‘did in the Great
War’ that I’ll tell my son about. It was in the Argonne, and
I was in command of a battalion—had been for a long time.
We were in a fairly isolated position. You know what the
Argonne was—woods, lightly held as to numbers by the
enemy, careful, oh, so careful, machine-gun nests everywhere!
We’d had terrible losses but had plugged on
through, little by little. Paused at last. Sat still for about
a week. Being bombarded in a desultory fashion, but
comfortable enough—comparatively. This was November.
Well, on November tenth, in the morning, I learned something
that I hadn’t any business to learn,—that the Armistice
was coming absolutely. On November tenth at four <span class='sc'>P.M.</span>
I received orders to attack the position in front of us—sweet
little hill, picture-puzzle of machine-guns—at five <span class='sc'>A.M.</span> the
next morning, November eleventh—November eleventh!
Well, I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s smile disappeared, and his face took on again
that intensity that seemed to reveal the presence within him
of some single dark absorbing passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think of it!” he said. “The cold-blooded futile murder
in such orders—given why? How should I know? Because
Headquarters didn’t care about going through the
red tape of changing their prearranged plans, I suppose.
Anyhow,” he concluded, “I didn’t obey. I stood out for
once against the machine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did they do to you when they found out?” and:
“Did the soldiers under you know?” cried Phil and
Catherine simultaneously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say as to my men. My lieutenants knew. They’d
never have split on me. But of course I was found out.
There we still were, you see, after the Armistice, which
came that very day, in the same position as before. My
colonel, a decent fellow for a Regular Army officer, did the
least he could under the circumstances—relieved me of my
command and sent me as liaison officer to Italy, one being
called for about then. Whole thing very quiet. No fuss
made. I should think not! Wouldn’t I have loved a fuss?
But the fact remains,” he said, “that, having set out to ‘make
the world a better place to live in’ (wasn’t that the way
my departure was explained?—not at the time, of course;
then we were to ‘keep our minds neutral’—but posthumously,
after three years) I return, having made it a place,
of no matter what sort, for a hundred young men or so
still to be alive in. They’d have been rotting in neat little
graves but for me. And that’s all. I got demobilized over
there—eventually—in Italy, and came back, a free man in
spite of the uniform, on the ‘Dante.’ And here I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned back and lit still another cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you know what people are going to say to you?”
asked Catherine in an odd voice. “They’re going to say:
‘Stacey, you smoke too much.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she buried her head in her hands and burst
out sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both men started, and Philip half rose, then sat down
again, pulling his moustache and considering her helplessly.
Stacey gazed at her with a kind of grim sadness, as if from
an immense distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me!” she said at last, controlling herself and
wiping her eyes. “It—it isn’t because you’re bitter, Stacey,”
she went on wearily after a moment, choosing her words
with difficulty, “and, oh, not at all because you feel—burned
out and unaffectionate. It’s—Phil, you tell him. I
can’t talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because Catherine is tired,” said Phil simply. “With
all that you’ve been through, it would be too much to ask
you to sympathize with what she’s been through. But, infinitely
less than your experience, that’s been a lot, too. She
always looked at things squarely—more squarely than I.
And what are you going to do when the truth you’re seeking
comes marching at you with great steps from a long way
off and shows itself a bleak brutal thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey gazed at his friend with intellectual sympathy
at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil went on slowly. “We believed in the war, too. Perhaps
not quite so ardently as you, but we believed in it. It
seemed, in the big essentials, right against wrong. We were
told—oh, you know all the things we were told, the dreams
we lived on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All to end in this,—this bitter merciless peace, with all
the seeds of new wars in it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” asked Stacey, “when you saw the futile pettiness
that revealed itself in men, and the pomposity, and the
selfishness, and the greed”—he spat the word out—“did you
expect anything better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not after a while, no,” Phil replied steadily. “At first I
did. When I saw the heroism. What happened to the war?
A great wrong <span class='it'>was</span> done. Hundreds of thousands of you
went to war nobly to right it. Belgium <span class='it'>was</span> invaded,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t remember,” said Stacey. “I suppose so. You
touched the truth when you said we ‘went to war.’ What
did we go to? Suppose one ant massacred another and you
arranged an earthquake to punish it. That’s what happened.
You see, a time came,” he continued slowly, an odd dazed
look in his eyes,—“about 1916 it began, I should think—when
all the surface seemed to have been stripped from life,
one layer after another, until there was nothing left showing
but universal naked pain. Nothing mattered except this. It
was so much bigger than anything else. Belgium didn’t matter.
Prussian militarism was a word. Love and hate disappeared,
unimportant. Nothing was left but pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine drew a long breath. “And then?” she
murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then,” he returned, “you went on existing somehow,
impersonally, without any emotions—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure?” Phil broke in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And without one tattered shred of an illusion left. I
made up a story about it once—it must have been in 1916.
Imagine a man who has always lived in a house with a roof
of beautiful stained glass, and who revels in the soft colors
that shine through. One day a tremendous hail storm
comes and shatters the glass to fragments and lets the bleak
white daylight pour in. Well, at first the man is heart-broken.
But, after a little, he thinks: ‘Anyway this is truth.
This is <span class='it'>real</span> light. I’ve been living falsely.’ So he bends
down to the marble floor to see what has done the damage,
but all that he can find is a little pool of dirty water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip and Catherine stared at Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter shook his head impatiently. “But that’s all
past,” he said coolly. “That was 1916. I give you my
word that I don’t think about myself at all any more. It’s
an effort, trying to. I haven’t any thoughts, and I don’t
care a rap for any one, and there isn’t anything I want to do,
but I’m jolly well not going to do anything I <span class='it'>don’t</span> want to
do. So that’s that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine rose. She seemed quite her calm self again.
She even smiled. And there was only a slight unsteadiness
in her voice when she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, it isn’t, Stacey!” she said. “You don’t want to
stay to dinner with us, but you’re going to, all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “All right,” he assented.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish,” thought Stacey nervously, when, on the afternoon
of the next day but one, his train, slowing down, was
passing through the suburbs of Vernon, “I wish that old
things would either die outright or else live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For there in the distance crept by, on its hill, the Endicott
School, where he had gone as a boy; here was a sudden
glimpse of the Drive, where he had often motored with
Marian. And old emotions stirred feebly within him like
ghosts of their dead selves. He did not want them; they
annoyed him. They had nothing to do with Stacey Carroll,
1919. They made him conscious of himself, that he had
a self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were worse than anything he felt at sight of the
small crowd which awaited him as the train swept into the
station. Amusement submerged all other feelings then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord!” he exclaimed, “the conquering hero!”—and
plunged down into the tumult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was his father, his face rigid with repressed emotion,
his hand shaking Stacey’s vigorously. And there were
half a dozen of his old friends standing back to let the
family have free play. And here was his sister, Julie, fatter
than in 1914, laughing and crying and kissing him and trying
to talk all at once, while her pleasant-faced husband, Jimmy
Prout, smilingly held out a hand across her shoulder and
managed to grasp one of Stacey’s fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did they really care so much as all this for him? Stacey
wondered, with remorse at feeling so little himself. Or was
it just the dramatic moment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then all at once his coolness was swept away by a gust
of genuine emotion, the last he should have felt—anger and
something like horror. For Julie had bent over and lifted
high her five-year-old son, and the child had on a tiny khaki
uniform and was saluting his uncle solemnly, fingers stiffly
touching his over-seas cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, Julie!” cried Stacey, his face white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proud smile suddenly vanished from his sister’s face.
She stared at him in hurt surprise. “What’s the matter,
Stacey?” she stammered. “Don’t you like him? Don’t you
like Junior?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I like him!” he muttered. “It’s just the
uniform. Don’t put it on him, Julie.” He swung the boy
up in his arms. “Don’t salute, old fellow!” he said, sweeping
off the little cap from the blond curls. “Give us
a kiss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I thought you’d like it!” said Julie wretchedly. “I
trained him so carefully to salute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, old girl!” said Stacey, putting the child
down. His wave of emotion had disappeared. He was
vaguely sorry to have hurt his sister’s feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other people had crowded up. The station rang with
greetings. But, through the insistent pressure forward of
Mr. Carroll, Senior, who had hold of his son’s arm, Stacey
presently found himself at the waiting motor car, into which
the train porter (thanks to Jimmy Prout’s directions) had
piled Stacey’s bags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye for now,” said Julie, giving her brother another
kiss. “We’re going to take Junior home, but we’ll be
out at dad’s for dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Stacey was in the tonneau of his father’s car, with
only his father by his side. The car moved off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll drew a long breath. “Ouf!” he exclaimed.
“So you’re back at last, son!” he said, after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back at last. Deuce of a long time, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll nodded gravely. “Longer than any one can
imagine. I’ve missed you terribly, Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man found himself wondering. Was it true?
Was affection a real and vivid thing? He, Stacey, had had
his life, such as it was, in these four years and a half. He
had not missed his father, save in a mild way now and then.
Well, his father, too, had had his own life. His days must
have been taken up with business. He must have dined
out frequently in the evenings or have had people to
dinner. Had his thoughts truly clung to Stacey? Wasn’t
it all half a convention? Between a child, helpless, appealing,
undeveloped, and a father, protective, tender,
apprehensive of a thousand infant dangers,—there, indeed,
was a poignant relationship! Afterward?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that Stacey was not fond of his father. He was fond
of him even now, but without pretence, decoration or melodrama.
And, though he pursued these idle thoughts in a cool
detached way, he was not quite cool, not quite detached.
“You don’t look a day older, dad,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? I ought to. I feel older—or did till just now.”
Mr. Carroll scrutinized his son’s face affectionately. “<span class='it'>You</span>
look older, son,” he continued, “older in a good sense—grown
up, surer of yourself. It’s made a man of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for a faint sense of irony, this estimate produced
no impression at all on the young man. He was simply not
interested in the subject. However, his father pursued it
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looking you over, five years ago, a business man would
have said: ‘Charming boy, young, fresh, eager, full of ideas,
but something of a dreamer.’ To-day he’d think: ‘There’s a
strong man that I could put at the head of a big company’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Careful, sir!” said Stacey. “Remember that anything
you say may be used against you. I might take you up
on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden gleam shone in Mr. Carroll’s eyes. “You mean
that?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His son laughed. “Don’t really know yet. Maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not going back into architecture? Not enough fight in
it now, eh? Want something more vigorous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Stacey, “I’m not going back into it, architecture,
at once, anyway. Want to look around a bit first.
Can’t say that I really know what my reasons are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His answer was strictly truthful. He did not know his
reasons—except that he literally couldn’t have drawn plans
for so much as a barn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father nodded, then, catching sight of a man who was
walking briskly along the sidewalk of the street down which
the car was gliding, told the chauffeur to stop, and, leaning
out, called: “Colin! Oh, Colin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Colin Jeffries, president of the smelting works,
president of the power plant, vice-president and dictator of
the great linseed oil mills, head of a dozen corporations,
donor to the city of its art gallery and public library, Vernon’s
first citizen. A man of fifty-five, vigorous, keen-eyed,
clean-shaven but for a short dark moustache. Not at all like
Mr. Carroll in features. As like him as one pea to another
in expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son, Colin. Captain Carroll. You remember him.
Just got back. Wanted you to shake hands with him.
D. S. C.—‘for cool leadership and conspicuous bravery
in action.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Mr. Jeffries, shaking Stacey’s hand
warmly and gazing straight into his eyes. “Glad to see you
back, my boy. Very genuinely glad. Congratulations aren’t
much, but you have them. We older men, who couldn’t go,
aren’t going to forget what you young men did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Stacey, considering him coolly. It occurred
to him that it was quite right of Mr. Jeffries to be
grateful, since one thing the young men had done was
to make him considerably richer than formerly. However,
Stacey did not think this with any bitterness, or accuse the
millionaire of a self-interested patriotism or of anything else.
He was simply no longer—as he had once been—impressed
by the legend of the man. He merely scrutinized him coldly
from outside and reserved judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s another reason we’re glad to have you back,”
Mr. Jeffries was saying gravely. “You young men have
saved the country from one danger. We count on you to
save it from another. You’ll find probably that you’ve got
to keep on saving it. Conditions are chaotic. The country’s
full of social unrest. You’ll see.” (Mr. Carroll nodded assent
emphatically.) “Malignant forces are at work secretly.
It’s you boys of the American Legion who will be the greatest
factor for good in the country’s life for the next generation.
Rest? You won’t find rest. Do you want it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not particularly, Mr. Jeffries,” Stacey replied calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Good luck to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine man, Colin!” Mr. Carroll observed, as the car
moved off again. “A great citizen and a true friend. Not
a stain on his reputation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey did not contradict the assertion, even inwardly.
He merely reserved judgment and was not especially interested
in what the result of it would be. The only positive
comment he passed (to himself) was that Mr. Jeffries talked
rather like an orator on a platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, by Jove!” exclaimed Mr. Carroll suddenly, “I completely
forgot! Selfish of me! Marian called me up and
asked me to tell you that she wouldn’t expect you to-night—said
she realised the family had first rights to you—but
would look for you to-morrow afternoon, three-thirty.
Considerate of her, though hard on you perhaps. Nice girl,
Marian, very! Showed uncommon good sense in not coming
to the station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Carroll would have been dismayed had he known
the effect his apologetic explanatory remarks produced upon
his son. They weighed Stacey down. For it is the extraordinary
truth that not once since Stacey descended from the
train had the thought of Marian crossed his mind, and that
to have it recalled to him now was burdensome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, he recovered quickly from the sudden feeling
of depression. For, being totally without any scheme of
life, he lived from day to day and met problems only as they
arose. Marian was to-morrow’s problem. He shook it off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said. “It’s right of her. Of course I
want this evening at home with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when finally they were at home Stacey and his father
found little to say to each other. Mr. Carroll was full of
the nervous restlessness of repressed affection, bustled
about, made his son a cocktail (which Stacey drank with
relish), and finally threw himself down in a chair and lit a
cigar, though it was close to dinner time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was more self-possessed, though he could not be
entirely self-possessed in this house where all the edges of
things and thoughts were blurred by memories out of childhood.
He was able to recognize clearly, with no more than
a touch of sadness, that at bottom he and his father had
little in common. Stacey felt that he ought to be expansive,
communicative, but he simply could not be. Besides, he
had nothing to communicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, if Stacey revealed no characteristic for which he may
be loved, he did reveal one for which he may be admired:—self-control.
For when his father asked him, almost shyly,
about the action in which he had won his American decoration,
Stacey told the story of it, quietly, artistically, handsomely,
with even a smile on his lips, as one might tell the
story of Thermopylæ or Bunker Hill, while all the time
his eyes, that gazed off across his father’s shoulder, were
seeing the unendurable picture of the real thing. It was
an achievement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the tale was finished the older man drew a long
breath. “By Jove!” he exclaimed in a low voice, mingled
admiration and envy showing in his face. “To live through
moments like those! Wonderful! Moments you’ll never
forget!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey, who had risen and was leaning against the
empty fire-place, gave an odd sound like a strangled laugh.
He crossed the room to a tall window, flung it wide open,
and surreptitiously wiped a drop of perspiration from his
forehead. Then he turned back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make me another cocktail, dad,” he said. “Do! We
couldn’t get gin like that in Italy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a relief to Stacey when Julie and her husband
arrived. For he craved of his sister now precisely what had
irked him in her formerly—her apparent absence of any
inner life and her absorbed occupation with externals. If
any one had protested that she probably did have an inner
life he would have assented cheerfully. He simply did not
want to know about it or about any one else’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prouts were a little late (Julie was always a little
late) and Mr. Carroll, who had been fidgeting with increasing
exasperation, greeted his daughter wrathfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound it, Julie! Can’t you be on time for once in a
way? Isn’t it as easy to get here at seven as at seven-ten?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, daddy, it wasn’t my fault,” said Julie, her
voice and eyes full of hurt innocence, while her husband
grinned. “I was all ready and then at the very last
moment—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” her father interrupted. “If only you wouldn’t
always have an excuse! Come on in! Everything will be
cold, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And such things put Stacey in good humor. Indeed,
among them he enjoyed himself more than later when the
first two courses had been served and his father was ready
for conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Jimmy!” Julie was saying. “He <span class='it'>was</span> so unhappy
not to get across! After he’d gone through officers’ training
camp they sent him to Camp Grant and just kept him there
the whole time. He was so mad, weren’t you, Jimmy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said her husband pleasantly, “it <span class='it'>was</span> a good deal
of a bore to go through all that training and then never have
a chance to use it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’ll come in handy for the next war,” Stacey
observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Stacey!” his sister cried, “you don’t think there’s
going to be another!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “I was only trying to comfort you, Julie.
Thought from the way you spoke you’d like to give Jimmy a
chance. Just think of it!—there he’d be on a big white
horse, waving his sword and charging the enemy, with all
his men following him and cheering madly! Wouldn’t you
like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy grinned at his brother-in-law, but Julie shook her
head soberly, though perhaps she was only playing at being
as ingenuous as all that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said firmly, “I wouldn’t. Jimmy plays a good
game of golf, but he’s no use at all on a horse—never was.
And I think it would be nice enough—now—for him to <span class='it'>have</span>
got across and <span class='it'>have</span> had a medal, like you, Stacey dear, so
that I could say: ‘I don’t think you’ve met my husband, Mrs.
Jones. You see, he’s been in France for two years. Oh,
yes, D. S. C., <span class='it'>of</span> course!’—but at the time I never did want
him to go, not for a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young men laughed again. Stacey considered his
sister’s point of view human, straightforward and sensible.
Where was the good, he wondered swiftly, in going through
a lot of complicated emotions, since, if you were honest, you
always ended in just such simplicity? It was a lot better to
be simple in the first place and stay so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Carroll, who was in the midst of a swallow of
claret, gulped suddenly, choked, and set his glass down with
a bump. “That,” he said angrily, “is about as silly and weak
and unpatriotic as anything I’ve ever heard even you say,
Julie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help it, dad,” Julie returned meekly. “It’s the
way I really feel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you should keep still about it. Nice sort of part we
should have played in the war if every wife had taken that
attitude!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, who thought his sister was being badly scolded
for no reason at all, gave her a sly friendly smile, at which
her face brightened. She recovered so quickly, indeed, and
her husband had shown, throughout, such absence of any
discomfort, that Stacey concluded Julie must be inured to
this sort of harshness. He tried to remember whether his
father had always been so sharp with her, but couldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy would have had his chance, no doubt,” Mr. Carroll
remarked, “if the war had lasted a few months longer,
as it should have.” He frowned. “I believe,” he went on
solemnly, “that the Armistice will prove to be the biggest
disaster the world has ever known.” And he looked about
him fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first time that Stacey had heard this sentiment expressed
(at tea, in Rome, at the house of an elderly American
gentleman whom every one cultivated because he mysteriously
always had butter and sugar), he had first felt
genuine horror, and then immediately had flown into a white
ungovernable rage during which he said things that had
reduced the kindly old gentleman, who was used to having
every one pleasant, to a state of helpless trembling discomfort.
However, by now Stacey was growing used to the
sentiment (it had been mentioned, for instance, on the boat,
and the smoking-room of the Pullman car had rung with
it). It no longer produced in him any emotion save a
weary scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to have seen the Huns get a taste of their own
medicine,” Mr. Carroll continued, his eyes gleaming beneath
their heavy white eyebrows. “Only a month or two more
of the war and they’d have seen <span class='it'>their</span> soil invaded, <span class='it'>their</span>
towns in flames, and the Allies would have marched into
Berlin. Now hear them talk! They don’t know they’re
beaten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say they suspected it when they handed over their
fleet,” said Stacey calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t agree with me, son?” Mr. Carroll exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey shook his head. “It would have cost thousands of
lives more,” he remarked, helping himself to almonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so many! Not so many!” his father insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some,” said Stacey. “However,” he added in a dry
voice, “to do our leaders justice, I don’t think they gave that
point undue importance. The truth was we’d have had to
pause pretty soon, anyway. Our troops were fagged, our
lines of communication were impossibly long, and we’d shot
off most of our ammunition. A pause would have given
the Germans a chance to fall back on a nice short line all
prepared for them, and it would have taken another tremendous
battle to break through again,—and there was winter
already upon us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll had followed his son’s words attentively.
“Well, of course,” he said, “that’s different. I’m not a military
man and I don’t pretend to have become an expert
strategist, like most of my friends at the club. They’ll
amuse you, Stacey. All the same, it’s an outrage that the
Germans should get off scot-free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after this the subject of the war was dropped for
a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julie related personal gossip agreeably, and Jimmy Prout
told an amusing story about an eccentric client of his, and
Stacey listened with interest to both of them, but he observed
that his father did not listen. Mr. Carroll did pay
his son-in-law a perfunctory semblance of attention, but he
made no pretence of even hearing what his daughter said.
And he cut short her account of a country club feud with a
sudden irrelevant remark accompanied by an impatient
frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We passed Colin Jeffries on the way home, Jimmy,” he
said, “and stopped to speak with him. He said a few words
to Stacey about the rottenness of conditions over here
to-day, about what we’ve all got to face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy’s good-humored countenance became sober. He
nodded. “Yes,” he said, “it’s pretty fierce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Carroll had turned again to his son. “The whole
country’s full of social unrest,” he went on angrily. “You’ve
no idea, Stacey. All the lazy worthless Have-Nots are up
in arms against the Haves, and our damned government
pets them and plays right into their hands. Not a bit of
respect for the men who’ve made the country what it is.
You’ll see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen something of it abroad,” Stacey remarked.
“What do you expect? You have four years and a half of
universal war positively guaranteed to turn the world into
heaven, and then it ends with the world even less heavenly
than before. Of course you get unrest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had spoken idly enough, without much thought as to
what he said, save that he exercised care not to plunge into
the question truly, but he was not really apathetic; he was
curious about the intensity of feeling his father displayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I’m talking about definite, concrete, unjustifiable
demonstrations of unrest,” Mr. Carroll continued, shaking
off generalities. “Here you have labor, the one real profiteer
in the war, getting more and more, more than it ever got,
far more than its share, yet always increasing its demands,
always doing less work. Why, it takes three men nowadays
to get through a piece of work that one man could do a few
years ago. Bolshevism! Sheer Bolshevism!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julie bravely ventured a remark. “You remember Harry
Baird, Stacey?” she said, with a little laugh. “He’s a contractor,
you know. Well, he says that nearly all his men
drive up to work in their own Fords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed, too, though he kept his eyes on his
father’s face. Mr. Carroll seemed to have relapsed into his
former state of indignant meditation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I ask you,” Julie concluded, “what more <span class='it'>do</span> they
want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” Stacey observed lightly, “they probably want to
drive up in Packards. You see, if you’ve had power—that
is to say, if you’ve had money—for a long time, you don’t
much care whether you ride around in a Packard or a
Ford—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I care!” Julie broke in. “A Ford is awfully jolty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you care because one is more comfortable. What I
mean to say is that a Packard isn’t to you a belligerent symbol
that you’re as good as anybody else. I dare say it is to
the laborer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Carroll had emerged from his thoughts and was
looking at Stacey keenly. “Son,” he said soberly, “you’ve
done your duty heroically. You’ve gone through a tremendous
ordeal and you’ve gone through it without flinching.
Don’t go back on what’s right now, will you? Keep
on going straight. Don’t let yourself get infected with
Bolshevism. You’re not, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey considered his father thoughtfully and with a faint
but genuine sadness—almost the only touch of a soft emotion
he had felt since his arrival. For, though his remarks
to Julie had been careless and superficial, they had just
grazed the outside of something in which he really believed,
as much as he believed in anything. And it was precisely
these remarks which had alarmed Mr. Carroll. Stacey could
not make his father out, and still less did he make himself
out, but, whatever his father was, and whatever he himself
was, it was clear that an impassable gulf lay between them.
They had nothing in common save affection and memories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, when he answered his father, he did so as
gently and circumspectly as the truth (his one remaining
god) would permit; which was rare, since in general he was
careless enough of others’ feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, dad,” he said slowly, smiling at his father, “I
don’t believe I’m tainted with Bolshevism. I know almost
nothing about it and don’t trust what I do know. Propaganda
for, propaganda against,—that’s all we’re getting; not
facts. In so far as I can make out the theory I don’t like it—too
crushing for the individual. What we want is more
individualism than before the war, not less. But I think it’s
a mistake to hate a word, because hate reveals fear. One
ought not to be afraid of anything. Now you’ve probably
got all kinds of unrest over here, just as everywhere else.
Some of it, I dare say, is right, some wrong—mere abuse of
power. Well, nobody ever yet had power without abusing
it. The teachers in your schools, the professors in your colleges,
the salaried clerks in your offices, are restless, poor
things! as well as the laborers in your factories and the men
who deliver your coal. What I’m trying to say is that these
are all different kinds of restlessness. Don’t go and lump
them together and give them a name and then shudder or
get angry at it. You’re drilling your enemies that way,
handing them out a uniform, and urging a lot of your
friends to join them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lot in what you say, Stacey,” said Jimmy
Prout. “We’ve enough enemies without adding to them unnecessarily.
I’m all for the school teachers myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Mr. Carroll, he had sat silently gnawing at his
gray moustache during Stacey’s discourse, and he remained,
now that it was over, still appearing to reflect upon it. But
at the sound of a sharp pop behind him he started, shook his
head as though to rid himself of troubles, and watched the
champagne being poured into his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” he cried, with a smile that softened his firm
handsome face, and rose to his feet. “Here’s to Stacey,
D. S. O., D. S. C., and my son! Thank God, he back’s home
again, with his duty accomplished!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The evening, pleasant as it was, left Stacey with a feeling
of emptiness. When he had finally said good night to his
father and gone upstairs to his own study he wandered about
it restlessly, smoking cigarettes and staring blankly at one
after another of the objects with which he had once affectionately
filled it. Everything and every one, he said to
himself, were just the same—or almost. It was inconceivable.
He had gone through something that had destroyed
every particle of his former self, and now he came
back to just what he had left. Not, he reflected, that he
wanted his people changed, certainly not in the way he was
changed—whatever that was. What the devil did he want?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, for one thing, he would rather like to be able to feel
a little more. Toward Phil and Catherine Blair, for example.
He knew that he had treated them badly. What sort of
gratitude had he returned them for their open-hearted welcome?
He shrugged his shoulders. He couldn’t help it. It
was all he had felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, even though only intellectually, he was
sorry. And all at once he found something he could do
about it, and felt immediate relief. To do something had
become his sole means of relief in any situation. He sat
down at the desk in his study and drew out paper and ink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he paused for a moment, reflecting. Of course
he might be mistaken about it. Phil might be prospering.
He remembered that he hadn’t even asked. But he shook
his head. No, the signs were clear enough. And, if he was
mistaken, it would anyway do no harm to write. He
dashed off the brief letter at once, never pausing for the
best word or expression.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dear Phil: It has occurred to me that under present
building conditions you might be having rather a struggle
of it on your own in New York. I’m writing to know
whether you would consider coming out here for a time—or
permanently, if you can stand the place. I think I could
find you a job with my old firm. You’d be a great acquisition
for them, you’d bring a little more vulgarity into our—what’s
the word?—etiolated architecture, and you could
live through this difficult and expensive period without
worrying about how to make both ends meet. Of course I
know what your independence means to you, and I may be
all wrong in assuming that you would consider abandoning
it temporarily; but I figure that when the difficulty of existence
passes a certain mark it becomes absorbing to the point
of destroying most of one’s real life, and that this mark is
pretty sure to be passed by any young man trying to be an
architect on his own in New York City to-day.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I’ll add a postscript to-morrow morning after I’ve seen
Parkins (the head of my firm).</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Good night.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>“<span class='it'>Yours</span>,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1.5em;'>“<span class='it'>Stacey.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey glanced the letter through swiftly, folded and
addressed it, and laid it on the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went to bed and fell asleep at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waking early the next morning he did not lie still
through those moments of delicious indolence in which
most men indulge themselves, but slipped out of bed immediately
and into his cold bath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His body responded to the shock glowingly. It was
magnificently fit. The muscles of his back and abdomen
rippled smoothly as he rubbed himself with the rough
towel. One would justly have admired Stacey as a healthy
handsome animal. And it may be that his obstinate distaste
for speculation, his barely conscious, undeliberate
desire to avoid thought, arose out of his animal instinct of
self-preservation, was but the deep determination not to
allow his strong sane body to be affected by his sick and
twisted mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took from the closet a pre-war suit of his, a soft
gray, civilian suit, and in regarding it felt a keener joy than
he had felt in stepping off the steamer or in seeing Phil
and Catherine or in drinking champagne last evening—a
keener joy, alas, than he felt when he had donned the
clothes; for they did not seem natural and easy to his militarized
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went downstairs and out of doors into the well-kept
garden. It was still only seven o’clock and nobody
was about—not even his father, who was an early riser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Carroll did presently appear. “Well, you <span class='it'>are</span>
changed, Stacey!” he called jovially, as he drew near
through the tall rose bushes. “Seems to me I remember the
time when for you to get down to eight o’clock breakfast
was—hello!” And he surveyed his son critically. “Back
in civilian clothes already, eh?” he observed meditatively.
“Well, that’s right, I suppose. You <span class='it'>are</span> a civilian again, of
course. And I don’t think much of these lads who go
flaunting their uniforms about for months after they’re
out of the service, determined to wring the last drop of
credit from their performance of duty. Still .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He
paused. “Well,” he concluded cheerfully, “there’s one thing.
You can put on all the civilian clothes you like, but nobody
with half an eye would be deceived. You don’t look like a
civilian. You look like a soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it all!” said Stacey, exasperated, “I know I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father laughed. “Come on in to breakfast. Do
you still eat that idiotic excuse for a meal you used to—coffee
and two bites of a roll?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Stacey, “I eat bacon, eggs, fish—anything I
get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, you <span class='it'>have</span> improved!” Mr. Carroll exclaimed,
with another laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast Stacey drove into town with his father,
but left him at the door of the Carroll Building and
walked briskly along the street until he came to the building
in which Parkins and May, the architects with whom
he had worked before the war, had their offices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was asked his business formally by the office-boy,
new since his time, but waved him aside and opened the
door of Mr. Parkins’s private room a little way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said Mr. Parkins. “Oh, by the Lord! it’s Stacey
Carroll! Come in! Come in!” he cried, rising and holding
out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was pleased at the welcome. There exists between
people who have worked hard together a camaraderie,
approaching affection, but pleasanter since it makes
no demands on expression. Stacey felt it for the men of
his battalion; he had forgotten that he felt it for any one
else. The rediscovery was a small pleasant surprise. He
shook the architect’s hand cordially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I saw by the paper this morning that you
were back,” Mr. Parkins was saying, “but I’m blessed if I
expected you to get around here to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought I’d drop in,” said Stacey, collapsing lightly
into a chair. “How are you?” And he scrutinized the
older man’s shrewd clean-shaven face, which showed
around the eyes little worried wrinkles, brought there by
the perpetual endeavor to reconcile clients’ ideas with some
modicum of architectural consistency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty well! Pretty well!” Mr. Parkins replied. “These
have been lean years, as you know. No building to speak
of. But we’ve got all we can do again now and more too,
even though the cost of material and labor is so high you’d
think it would be prohibitive. But a good many people
have made a good deal of money, and, after all, houses
have got to be built. There aren’t enough to go round. We
surely can use you, Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” said Stacey. “Sorry to disappoint you, but I’m
out of the running for a while. Not coming back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not! Oh, now, look here! May and I talked
it over and decided we’d offer you a junior partnership
right off the bat, and now you—what’s wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re awfully kind,” said Stacey, “but honestly I can’t—and
I swear I don’t know why. I give you my word I
couldn’t draw plans for a—bill-board at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry!” Stacey remarked. “But that’s the way it is.”
He smiled ironically. “All this returned-soldier-restlessness
stuff, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Parkins considered him closely. “Now what <span class='it'>have</span>
you gone and done to yourself?” he observed at last. “You
<span class='it'>look</span> like Stacey Carroll, yet you don’t seem quite like him.
I believe,” he added, with a laugh, “I really believe I’m half
afraid of you. You’re a—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little changeling, yes,” said Stacey, bored. “Now listen,
Mr. Parkins,” he went on quickly. “There’s something I
want to ask you to do for me. It’ll be a favor to me and
a good turn to yourself at the same time.” And he stated
Philip Blair’s case, without mentioning his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Parkins thoughtfully, “it might be done,
of course. We’ll need a new man, since you’re not coming
back for now—confound you! But what we need is a
good safe man. Is your friend—what’s his name, by the
way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Philip Blair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Parkins uttered an exclamation. “Oh, I’ve seen <span class='it'>his</span>
work!” he said. “Happened on a perfect wonder of a
library he did in a small New York town. The villagers
disliked it immensely. I asked about him afterward. He’s
the real thing; but the idea of your recommending him to
me as a safe man! It’s outrageous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be as safe as you like,” Stacey insisted. “Five
years of what he’s been trying to do would have crushed
the danger out of an anarchist. Try him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Parkins, “I will. I’ll try him, because
I think it’s a shame a man like that should be so hard
pressed, but I know I’m making a mistake. You can write
Blair that if he wants to come I’ll give him twenty-five
hundred a year on a year’s trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An odd spasm contracted Stacey’s features, but passed
at once. “Oh, but I say,” he protested, in a dead emotionless
voice, “you were giving me four thousand before the
war!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Parkins shook his head. “I’ll make it three thousand,
but not a cent beyond,” he said firmly. “Philip
Blair’s a genius. A genius isn’t worth more than three
thousand to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “I like the implication,” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he added a postscript to his letter and sent it off to
Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At three-thirty precisely Stacey was at Marian’s house.
He knew he had a problem to face, since it was unfortunately
true that he had no love left for Marian and did not
desire to marry either her or any one else. But he had no
plan and he had not said to himself that he would not marry
her. He had not said anything at all to himself. He merely
went to her house as per schedule. All that he felt was a
sense of something burdensome—and just a little faint
curiosity. After all, he had loved this girl once upon a
time. That was it. “Once upon a time” exactly expressed
it. It was the way you began fairy-tales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was relieved, if so slender an emotion can be called
relief, that it was not Marian who opened the door of the
house to him. He had been a little afraid that Marian
herself would welcome him with an impetuous rush. But
the door was opened by a maid—and not even the one the
Latimers had had in the old days, at which also Stacey
somehow felt relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the drawing-room, hoping to find Mrs.
Latimer there; for, besides feeling that her presence would
put off the demand for emotional moments, he really did
want to see her. But she was not there. The room was
empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went over and stood with his back to the fire-place
and looked around him, an odd smile drawing at one corner
of his mouth. For again he was feeling the weak futile
tug of old discarded emotions. These vases and chairs and
statuettes, the whole familiar setting of the room, reminded
him of what he had once felt in their presence; which is
the same as saying: what he had once been. Stacey was like
a boat floating on the water, almost solitary, almost loose,
but not quite; still attached by a frayed cord or two to his
old self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the portières at one end of the room were parted
gently, and Marian stood between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey caught the soft sound and saw her at once. But,
as he gazed at her, he continued to smile the same smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, what he felt was mixed. He was straightforwardly
contemptuous of her melodramatic behavior, unexpectedly
struck by her fine beauty, and stirred uneasily
by memories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, that half pleasurable discomfort is all that most
long-parted lovers truly feel on meeting again, no matter
how earnestly in letters they may have lashed their old
emotion to keep it awake. But, since, even though changed,
they are still they, the discomfort readily grows again to
love in the renewed proximity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not with Stacey. He was no longer Stacey Carroll, 1914.
He was a different person. His discomfort faded, flickered
and went out—all in the brief moment of silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly are beautiful, Marian,” he said appreciatively,
but without moving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she returned, with a ripple of laughter, “I’m glad
you still think so—and feel so sure of it.” She moved
slowly forward a few steps, toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind was quite clear now and working swiftly. He
thought rapidly that five years ago this demeanor of
Marian’s would have set his heart to throbbing with delight.
He would have likened Marian to a shy, half tamed bird,
fond yet afraid of being caught. What an idiot he had
been! To-day he coldly found her behavior absurdly
affected. All these little airs and graces! Fiddlesticks!
But, far more strongly than admiration of Marian’s beauty
and cool scorn of her coquetry, Stacey was feeling elation,
because it was now obvious to him that she did not love
him, probably had never loved him. Frank love would not
accord with these mincing ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet with all this only a few seconds of silence elapsed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey crossed the room to a divan and threw himself
down easily into one corner of it. “Come on over here,
Marian,” he said comfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood still and looked at him, half archly, half in a
puzzled way. “Stacey, you are—you are the most ardent
lover!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you!” he retorted calmly. “Let’s sit down and talk
over our passion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian flushed and gave something like a pettish stamp
of her small foot. “I won’t!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t!” he returned, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, she seemed to think better of it, for she did
come slowly to the couch and perched herself on the end
opposite Stacey. She sat there gazing at him, one foot on
the upholstery, elbow on knee, her small pointed chin resting
in her cupped hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, still smiling, considered her. “You’re perfect like
that,” he said sincerely. “Some Greek sculptor of the
Fourth Century—no, the Third—ought to have carved you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey, don’t you love me any longer?” she asked softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started up. “You’re horrid!” she cried furiously.
“Each time that I ask you a question you ask me one in
return. I’ve waited for you—nearly five years—and this
afternoon I looked forward to your coming and sent everybody
out of the house, and then when you come you look
at me as though I were an <span class='it'>objet d’art</span> and laugh at me—laugh
<span class='it'>coldly</span> at me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at <span class='it'>you</span>, Marian,” he said quietly. “I couldn’t laugh
at you. I find I don’t know you at all. Come! Forgive me
for being rude. Let’s talk everything over soberly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down again and looked at him hostilely. “I see
now why you didn’t write oftener,” she said haughtily. “I
thought it was because you were too busy. Fancy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t see,” he replied, “and it’s difficult for
me to explain, because I don’t understand very well myself.
Also the subject’s distasteful to me. But I owe it to
you to try to explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you do,” she said icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, unimpressed by her tone. “It’s like this,” he
went on, with an effort. “You’ve got to see me straight.
And if I’m brutal, why, so much the better for you. I’m
not only not the laurel-crowned knight of your flattering
princess’s fancy. I’m not even the person I really was
before I went away. Every bit of sweetness and light
has been burned out of me. I don’t get delicate soft sensations
out of anything any more. The overtones that you
love don’t exist for me. Nothing has any glamour. All I
can see in life is a mess of bare conflicting facts, stark
naked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had forgotten Marian. His eyes glowed and there
was a stern beauty in his face. Yet he was only leaning abhorrently
over the upper edge of the well. He missed
almost everything of importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he spoke, the girl’s features had lost their expression
of chill aloofness. Her lips were parted now, and she
gazed at him as though fascinated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I tell you that I don’t love you,” he concluded
fiercely, “I can honestly swear that it’s just that I don’t—can’t—love
any one or anything. My saying so shouldn’t
hurt anything but your pride, because you don’t love me,
either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned toward him ever so little. “How do you
know I don’t love you?” she demanded softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you create a setting, play a game, surround our
meeting with little tricks,” he returned, quite unmoved by
her coaxing grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at him intently, her breath coming and going
rapidly. “Then you don’t—you truly don’t—even want to
kiss me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned her gaze. Her coquetry did not stir him;
her beauty did. “Yes,” he said somberly, “of course I do!
But not because I find you shy and alluring. I don’t. Just
because you’re beautiful and desire’s a fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seized her small wrists and drew her toward him
slowly. She struggled fiercely at first, but then, when her
face was close to his, yielded suddenly and returned his
kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Now</span> don’t you love me, Stacey?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” he cried, releasing her. “Nor you me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and smoothed her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look precisely like a Tanagra,” he said admiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you say anything more of that sort,” she burst out,
“I shall hate you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do that, anyway,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at him strangely, an expression of cruelty in
her fine mouth. “Ames Price has been imploring me—for
two years now—to marry him,” she said slowly. “I think
I’ll do it. Would you mind, Stacey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced. “Mind? Of course I’d mind! Animal
jealousy, too, is a fact—nasty fact like all the rest of them!
But go ahead and marry him if you’ll be happy with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes shone for a moment with triumph. Then she
laughed musically. “What a weird afternoon!” she observed,
and pressed a bell in the wall. “Come! Let’s have
tea. You’re quite Byronic, Stacey!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, she was a sentimentalist, no doubt, but she was no
fool, Stacey admitted to himself. Come to think of it, he
was being Byronic in his intense antagonistic desire to stand
alone, freed from all ties.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Latimer was talking, although it was early afternoon
and therefore not his best hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The supreme importance of the arts,” he said, “is poise.
There is no poise in life itself. Life is mere tumult and
shouting. And since there is no poise there is no meaning.
The arts hover above the hurly-burly, dipping down into it
a little for delicate nourishment, but no more <span class='it'>of</span> it than a
cloud, which sucks its constituent vapor from the earth,
is of the earth. In the country of the arts there is quiet.
That is to say,” he added drily, “there was. The arts at
the moment have ceased to exist, and with them has
vanished all that we possessed of value.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt,” Stacey assented politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the beautifully enunciated phrases really gave him
a feeling of contempt for Mr. Latimer. And he wondered
how he could ever have admired this polished esthete. His
glance wandered to Marian (the only other person in the
room, her mother being out somewhere) who was curled
up in a large chair on the other side of her father. Stacey
considered the girl’s face attentively. She stirred him by
her beauty, especially when seen thus, motionless, carved;
yet left him, when everything was summed up, feeling actively
hostile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Latimer had taken a small vase from the mantelshelf
and was toying with it abstractedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leisure,” he remarked, “is anathema to Americans.
Yet leisure is all there is of importance. It is what all men
strive to attain through labor, but, having attained, are incapable
of supporting. It is too noble for their tawdry
energetic minds, and they hasten to fill it up with meaningless
movement. They even, I am told, go to witness what
they call ‘photo-plays,’ where, though themselves sitting
still, they can enjoy a vicarious restlessness and be saved
from the leisure they dread. How false an understanding
of life, or, rather, what complete lack of any understanding!
The goal of life itself is, after all, just the eternal leisure
of the grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An admirable epigram,” said Stacey, with no hint of expression
in his face. “I cannot make out whether it belongs
spiritually in the eighteenth century or in the nineties
of the last century.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In any case it does not belong in the twentieth,” Mr.
Latimer returned, a touch of irascibility in his voice. “Nor
do I.” He set the vase down almost with a bump. “I must
go,” he said. “I have an appointment, and here in America
every one is always on time.” And he left them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian uncurled herself gracefully. “Papa is cross,”
she observed, with a laugh. “It is only three o’clock, you
see. He does not approve of early afternoon. Let’s go to
the library, Stacey. I don’t like this room.” And she
danced off up the stairs, he following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She half knelt on a window-seat in the library and gazed
out, her mood seeming to change suddenly from hard to
soft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The clouds drift and drift,” she said dreamily. “And
sometimes they’re majestic and white with purple shadows,
as now, and sometimes they’re black and terrible, and
sometimes mere little pale ghosts of clouds. But they’re
always clouds. They haven’t anything to do with real
majesty or terror or ghosts. (Can one say ‘real ghosts,’
Stacey?) Only clouds. They just drift and drift. I
think I’d like to be a cloud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t you want to?” he observed callously,
“It’s your father’s theory all over again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She whirled around, her face mischievous. “Oh, how
funny you are, Stacey! You <span class='it'>won’t</span> care for me any more.
You’ll damn anything I do or say. You’re an enemy, out
and out,—oh, yes, you are! Yet you’d be glad enough to
kiss me this very minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he admitted angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re not going to,” she said, with haughtiness.
“Not now or ever.” She smiled. “Ames Price is coming to
see me to-night. Shall I let him kiss me? It would make
him so happy. I think it’s my duty to. Come! Let’s sit
down and talk of duty, Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she kept it up, as full of witchery as Circe, dazzling
in the bright rapid flash of her moods, swift and
lovely as a swallow, soft at one moment and clouded,—brilliant
and gemlike the next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, through it all, Stacey, though he talked freely
enough, was cold, distant and bored. He was like a man
idly watching a sorceress draw circles and pentagons in the
sand and murmur incantations. No spirits responded. No
enchantment ensued. It was merely laborious lines and
words, silly child’s play. The only thing that interested him—a
little—in the performance was the question of whether
or not it was deliberate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had continued to go daily to see Marian. He remained
unmoved by almost everything in her that had
formerly delighted him. There was no longer any magic,
any mystery. Yet he desired to be near her. Something she
did give him. But as to what it was he did not inquire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a strange relationship, but it is possible that
Marian found it piquant. She seemed fascinated by Stacey,
now that he was indifferent to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the girl sank lightly down upon an ottoman near
the young man’s feet and gazed up at him, as on that day
years before when he had come to tell her he was going
to the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the oddest person, Stacey!” she said, her eyes
shining. “Just like a great rock—a handsome rock. Why
do you come to see me? You don’t need to, you know.
You’ve broken our engagement—and my heart,” she continued
elfishly. “I shall tell every one that you have. It
will be in the newspapers. ‘Returned Hero Breaks Girl’s
Heart!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was better. There was something cool and hard
in this that appealed to Stacey, wakened a sense of surface
comradeship in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” he remarked, smiling. “Your heart seems to be
doing pretty well—if you’ve got one. <span class='it'>Have</span> you got one,
Marian?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a horrid habit you’ve acquired, Stacey,” she said
gaily, “of never answering a question, but always asking
another. I asked you why you came to see me. Well, since
you won’t tell me, I’ll tell you. You come to see me just
as you’d go to see the Parthenon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smile faded from his face. By Jove, she was right!
(Stacey Carroll, 1914, had been intelligently introspective;
Stacey Carroll, 1919, could always be surprised if some one
told him truth about himself. Also annoyed, generally. But
not this time.) Yes, that was it, he supposed. The bodily
fact of Marian wakened his atrophied sense of beauty—but
differently than in the old days, austerely save for the
touch of desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now when you can see things as straight as that why
do you go in so for everything rococo?” he demanded
harshly. “Why do you embroider and sentimentalize?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at him, her mouth compressed, her eyes brilliant
with anger—which was certainly justified. Then her
expression changed and she shrugged her shoulders, gracefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see,” she said calmly, “you were just asking a
silly careless question a moment ago. You don’t care
whether I have a heart or not.” She smiled again. “What
an odd pair we are!” she went on. “Poor me! Not engaged
any longer! Deserted after all these years! You
must be sure not to tell papa until you’ve given me time
to get engaged to some one else—Ames Price, I think you
said I might marry. Papa would be too awfully angry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” Stacey asked. “Is he so anxious to be rid of
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this Marian only laughed without replying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had of course seen Mr. and Mrs. Latimer more
than once by this time. His old admiration for Marian’s
father had gone, like so many other things. He found Mr.
Latimer a cultivated futile gentleman with an interest in
baubles and a talent for intelligent monologue. The only
thing about him that awakened any interest in Stacey was
a kind of irascibility that Stacey did not remember as formerly
characteristic of him. Mr. Latimer was really sharp
at times, in a suave polished way, with his daughter and
his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Latimer, though she had certainly aged, had
clearly not done so because of such trifles; for she bore
her husband’s occasional pettish outbursts with a pleasant
detached tolerance. They might have been the outbursts
of characters in a book she was reading, for all the effect
they appeared to have on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had welcomed Stacey with quiet happiness, and he
had felt at once a comfort in her presence which he felt in
that of no one else. Yet she had said nothing of importance
to him, had talked of externals even the time or two that
they had found themselves alone together for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left the Latimer house rather early on the afternoon
of this unsatisfactory interview with Marian. Something
about Marian antagonized him strongly, even now that he
was surely free; so that the impulse he felt to seek her
society repeatedly in this way revealed a bond of some
inexplicable sort and irked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked swiftly north till he came to the handsome
park the entrance to which lay at no great distance from
the Latimer home. And, plunging into the green shady
paths, he felt a sudden relief. To cut loose from it all—all
streets! all men! To be free! There was no joy for him
in the full-leafed June beauty of the trees or in the bird
songs among them,—no call to comradeship. Quite otherwise.
It was solely as release that he instinctively welcomed
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Striding aimlessly onward in this mood, Stacey suddenly
heard his name called and swung about quickly to see Mrs.
Latimer sitting on a bench at the edge of the path he followed
and waving a green parasol at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t help calling to you,” she said pleasantly,
“though I oughtn’t to. You look so splendidly alone, as
though you didn’t want to see any one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but yes,” he returned, “I’m glad to see you! No
one else; but you!” And he sat down on her bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what old woman could help having her head
turned by that?” she exclaimed, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He scrutinized her face. Yes, she had grown older, he
thought, but not ignominiously; in some way that made
age seem of value. Even in regard to her Stacey was not
curious as to what experiences of body or soul lay beneath
the changes her face showed; but he accepted what she
was, as a gracious fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you come from, Stacey?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From your house,” he replied, with an acid smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she observed, “so that’s why you were marching
along with the air of being so glad to be alone! Have you
broken—I mean, have you and Marian broken off your
engagement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Stacey coolly, “I believe so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this they were silent for a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he observed suddenly, as an afterthought, but
really with some little touch of human sentiment, “I hope
you won’t feel hurt! I should be sorry to hurt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” Mrs. Latimer exclaimed. “Gracious, no! I’m immensely
relieved. I wouldn’t have had you and Marian
marry for anything in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey did not know whether she was being a vixenish
mother-in-law or an unnatural mother, but he found her
remark amusing taken either way, and laughed. She
laughed with him, but more gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he added after a moment, “I forgot! Marian says
we must be sure not to let Mr. Latimer know at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” said Mrs. Latimer, as though it were too
elementary a truth to deserve mention. “Marian’s much
more intelligent than you ever gave her credit for being,”
she added, an instant later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know that,” Stacey admitted freely, even though
he did not see the present application of the remark, or,
indeed, why both Marian and her mother deemed it essential
that Mr. Latimer should not learn that the engagement
was off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” said Mrs. Latimer thoughtfully, poking
holes in the gravel with the tip of her parasol, “I could see
that things were not the same as once. Well, that was to
be expected. I shouldn’t have been at all surprised to have
you show a kind of—of fond indifference to Marian. But
what I don’t understand—there’s so much I don’t understand
about you, Stacey—is the positive hostility I’ve felt
sometimes in the looks you gave her. It was as though
you hated her. Why? Poor Marian! She’s just the
same as always. Is that itself—her sameness—the reason?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Stacey muttered, “of course not! I don’t know
why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you—find out why?” she asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey reflected, painfully and with resentment at the
need. Finally he drew his hand across his forehead and
looked at Mrs. Latimer. An odd fanatical intensity glowed
in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” he said, speaking thickly and with difficulty.
“I hadn’t thought. But perhaps it’s—because
Marian’s perfection is so—dependent on wealth. I see
Marian,” he went on, his words suddenly pouring out, “as
a flower that you get by fairly watering the ground with
money. Put her by herself in the panting sweating world and
what would she be? Her grace is money! Her ease—money.
All her charm—money! Everything in her except
her chiselled Greek beauty is money! I hate money!” And
he fell into tumultuous silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So <span class='it'>that</span> was it,” Mrs. Latimer said in a tired voice.
“Poor Stacey! Confidence for confidence,” she added abruptly,
after a pause. “Have you ever wondered why we
gave up Italy and came here to live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Often,” he answered, surprised. “I used to fancy it
was your decision—your feeling that Marian ought to know
America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled oddly. “<span class='it'>My</span> decision! It would make no
difference where Marian lived. She would never at any
point touch the real world. No, it was not my decision.
You see, our income, which was considered a tidy little competence
at the time Mr. Latimer inherited it, remained stationary
while the cost of everything grew and grew. America
was expensive, but in it Marian could marry money—money,
Stacey! And, of course,” she added, with a kind
of bravado, “you were a splendid <span class='it'>parti</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey felt sickened by the revelation. Oddly enough,
five years past, when he had been incorrigibly romantic, it
would not have disgusted him a tenth as much as now when
he was stripped clean of illusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” he remarked. “So to-day, with the present cost
of living, Marian simply must marry. What an economic
waste to have thrown away these five years in waiting for
me! Why do you tell me this, Mrs. Latimer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only because it’s a relief to tell somebody,” she replied,
“and because you said what you did about money, and because
I wanted to show you that one might feel as you did,
with even more reason, and still live and be tolerably happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then,” she concluded desperately, “because
truth is truth, and if I ever connived at anything against
you I want to tell you of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled. “You’re much more girlish than your
daughter,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were silent for a long while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then: “Did you have an awful, awful time, Stacey?”
she asked softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started. “Where? In France? Oh, yes, of course,”
he replied, in a matter-of-fact voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought of you so often,” she went on. “It must be
dreadful to be an idealist and then see all your ideals go—violently—one
by one—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Violently, yes,” he interrupted coolly. “Not one by
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crushed to death by facts—not average facts, all the
horrible evil facts herded together and organized until they
must have seemed normal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he said, “facts are facts! They aren’t either evil
or good. And you’re much too polite in saying that I was
an idealist. ‘Sentimentalist’ is the right word. Can’t say
that the method employed to remove my illusions was particularly
gentle, but I’m grateful enough for the removal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a look of pain on Mrs. Latimer’s face. “No!
No!” she cried. “It isn’t fair! There’s good disillusionment
and bad! It’s good to have false prettiness, false
sentiment—whatever is false—scrubbed off, but it isn’t
good, it isn’t fair to a man, to see only pain and death and
agony and mud for four years and be made to feel that
that’s all there is of true. It isn’t fair! It isn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s face was pale but calm and touched with a distant
haughty scorn of all things. “Oh, it wasn’t only that!”
he said in a chill voice. “I doubt if that was even the profoundest
lesson in disillusionment. That was the lesson of
pain and brutality and ugliness and fatigue—incredible fatigue.
It even had gleams of relief—flashes of lightning in
chaos. Men showed themselves beasts, but with a capacity
for enduring more suffering than you’d have thought possible.
There was funk, of course,—individual cowardice
and rank, bestial, mass terror, just as there was mass cruelty.
But there was amazing heroism, too. And the men
did carry on in spite of everything. Oh, no, the trouble
with the front line was the senselessness of squandering so
much life. The place to get real disillusionment—where
you learned the senselessness <span class='it'>and</span> sordidness of life itself—was
behind the lines, back where things were neat and
pretty, where the officers had feuds over questions of personal
prestige, and stupid fools gave orders disposing of
men’s lives, and the peasants gouged the soldiers for all they
were worth. Or back in Paris where the shop-keepers
gouged every one. And the Y. M. C. A. with their silly
sloppy Christianity—all for the best in the best of all possible
worlds! Or down in Italy, where butter and sugar
were rationed down to the minutest fragments and there
wasn’t enough so that women and children could always
get even those tiny rations, and yet some people had butter
on their table in quantities three times a day and bought
sugar in five-kilo packages at their back doors at six times
the established price. <span class='it'>And</span> the American Red Cross with
its silly pompous ‘majors’ and ‘colonels’ out for decorations!
‘Colonel’ So-and-So thought he’d been slighted, and ‘Major’
Thingumbob absolutely <span class='it'>was</span> going to be given a place on
the balcony when that ceremony came off, by God he was
or know the reason why! <span class='it'>And</span> the Committee on Public
Misinformation! And no coal to run trains enough to carry
the people who absolutely had to travel, and President Wilson
coming to Rome with a million journalists!” He
laughed harshly. “Or, for the matter of that,—America!
I haven’t seen very much of it yet, but I gather—oh, I
gather a great deal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey paused at last. But he did not look crushed or
dejected by his enumeration of abuses. He looked more
alive than before. He looked like a young, evil, disdainful
god.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mrs. Latimer whose face was white. “Poor
Stacey!” she murmured brokenly. “All true, no doubt, but
not the whole truth! Poor Stacey!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor me?” he asked. “Why? I’m all right, and free—or
almost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Free, or almost?” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He frowned. “Wisps of old things hang around futilely
and bother me a trifle—like soft fog around a ship, but I’ll
get rid of them,” he said confidently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So as to be free?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She reflected for a moment. “Why do you want to be
free?” she asked timidly. “What will you do with freedom,
Stacey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do with it? Nothing! It’s an end in itself. Isn’t it
aim enough to want to get rid of association with the kind
of thing I’ve been chronicling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “It might be. It isn’t <span class='it'>your</span> aim,
Stacey. And anyway one can’t be free. Oh, Stacey, forgive
an old woman who is fond of you,—but you—you’ve
come back a different person than you went away, and indeed
you must, to live, follow that old, old advice: ‘Know
Thyself’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you’re determined not to, but you must!” she
cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I,” he said coldly, “been regaling you with
reams about myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head again. “You haven’t even scratched
the surface. It’s late, my dear boy,” she added. “Please
take me home.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Blair and Stacey had been hunting houses. Catherine
and the boys were to come on when one had been found
and enough furniture rented to live with until their own
could be shipped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Houses to let were scarce, applicants numerous, and rents
high. But Stacey employed obstinate pressure and actually
presented his friend with a choice of three. Which, better
than anything else, indicates the position of the Carroll
family in Vernon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing was done, the lease signed, and the agent had
left them; but Phil and Stacey stood for a little while on
the wooden porch of Phil’s new house, looking down at
the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vernon was, for the most part, flat, but one hill of moderate
eminence it did possess, which, in the narrow early
days when the city was young and a man was deemed successful
if he had at sixty amassed a fortune of a hundred
thousand dollars, had been the supreme centre of fashion,
as was evidenced by the towers (to say nothing of the lightning
rods) on the now dingy frame houses. Stacey himself
had lived on this hill when a small boy, and the school he
had attended still crowned it. But those were the days
when Vernon’s best citizens boasted that Vernon had a
population of a hundred thousand (which it did not have).
Now Vernon had two hundred and twenty-five or perhaps
two hundred and fifty thousand, and its best citizens did
not much care. The crowded business section had flowed
to the foot of the hill and even burst like a wave upon it,
spattering its slopes with small garages and second-rate
shops. Noise rose and the odor of smoke. Fashion had
long since departed—to the edge of the city, where the
Carrolls lived, or still farther, to the hills that rose
beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey withdrew his eyes from the prospect and glanced
sharply about him at the porch, the steps, and the small
front yard. “Sordid kind of place to have to live in,” he
remarked. “Sorry I can’t get anything better for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Blair smiled his pleasant gentle smile. “You know
you don’t think that, Stacey,” he returned. “You’re only
saying what you take to be the proper thing. At heart you
don’t feel that it matters in the least where one lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose not,” Stacey assented absently. He was
again staring off at the city. It stretched out, monotonous
and unbroken save where the afternoon sunlight glittered
on the two converging branches of its sluggish river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish,” said Phil shyly, after a pause, “that you’d let
me thank you—for this whole business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, don’t!” Stacey exclaimed sharply.
“Thank me if I give you anything real—peace or—or freedom.
Don’t thank me for anything to do with money!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, he did not want to be thanked. Gratitude was
a bond, the recognition of gratitude a bond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil looked at him sadly, but Stacey did not see; his eyes
were still fixed on the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The solidity,” he muttered at last, “the damned solidity
of it! Did you ever see anything like it?” he burst out,
turning on Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The solidity of what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of that! Of the city! I didn’t feel it at first when I
got back. It’s getting on my nerves now. There are
churches in it where men preach at it, and lecture halls
where men talk at it, and auditoriums where it’s sung at
and played at,—faugh! Children with puffed-out cheeks
trying to blow down a house! Why, look at it! It’s only
sixty years old, yet it’s more eternally unchangeable than
the Pyramids!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Phil slowly, “what’s wrong with that? Why
should it change?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? The whole world has gone through agony, has
been wrenched and torn until not one atom of it, not one
emotion, not one value, remains as it was,—and here is
this damned ignoble changeless place that doesn’t know
there’s been a war—or pretends not to know, so that it
won’t be expected to change. Nothing can change it, I
tell you,—but bombs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” Phil asked steadily, “how do you want to change
it? What do you want to do for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing!” Stacey cried. “I don’t want to change it,
either for better or worse. Nobody can change what a
war like this couldn’t change. I want,” he concluded, his
eyes glowing strangely, “to wipe it out, annihilate it!
Bombs, I said. Nothing else is any good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of pain crossed Philip Blair’s face. “I think,”
he said, “that you’re a little mad, Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” said Stacey, with a short laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it isn’t only Vernon you’d have to destroy.
Everything’s that way—unchanging. It has to be, I suppose,
to endure. People have their own lives. They can’t
change so very much. Even mothers don’t die because their
sons have died. They suffer for a while, then forget. Vernon
and the Middle-West shock you now because they’ve
been too removed and too unimaginative to suffer at the
war. They’ve scarcely felt the war. While you’ve been in
places all raw with pain. But they, too, will get over it
and be like Vernon. It isn’t Vernon you’d have to destroy.
It’s all humanity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s face was inscrutable. Not a muscle in it had
moved. But his eyes had grown dark with a kind of
shadow. “Maybe,” he said again quietly. “Come on!
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went down the steps and along the brief board-walk
to Stacey’s car, which was parked before the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner was at seven, and they were in the living-room at
ten minutes to. It was the one admonition Stacey had given
Phil on the latter’s arrival the day before. “Do as you
please in everything—only be on time at meals,” he had
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll was waiting for them, with cocktails ready
to pour. He was in a genial mood and nodded appreciatively
at the younger men’s promptness. “Pleasure to have
to do with people who understand that seven means seven,”
he observed. “You wouldn’t believe, Blair, the trouble I
used to have with Stacey. He was almost as bad as his
sister in his contempt for time.” He poured the cocktails.
“Make them myself nowadays,” he explained. “I have
profound respect for Parker, but I don’t want to strain his
integrity too much. You can’t even trust the men at the
club not to rifle one another’s lockers. Not that Parker
wouldn’t make a more creditable member than a good many
of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dare say,” remarked Stacey. “But now this question
of being on time,—I can see two sides to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two?” his father exclaimed. “Not a bit of it! There’s
only one side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s a matter of two opposing theories of life. One
is that you should always be on time so as to avoid inconveniencing
one another and wasting energy and having
dishes get cold. The other is that you shouldn’t worry too
much about promptness or you let time get the upper hand
of you and run your life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks!” Mr. Carroll interrupted, “It will run
your life more if you neglect it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s a point for you. I knew an Italian family
in Rome, delightful people,—several branches of the family
there were—lived all over the city. They were always
going places together <span class='it'>en masse</span>. But it took them forever
to get assembled. Once they stood in the rain in three separate
bunches in three distinct and distant parts of Rome
because they’d all forgotten at just what time they were to
meet and where. No, you’re a slave if you disregard time
and a slave if you bow down to it. You’re had either way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” said Mr. Carroll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather think that there’s a little more to it,” Phil observed
quietly. “I think Mr. Carroll’s side is right. It <span class='it'>is</span>
better to be prompt. But not because you save time that
way and are more efficient. Rather because you establish
an apparent medium of smoothness to live in, make everything
<span class='it'>seem</span> permanent, eternal and of value. To have the
nine-seven train pull gently out of the Pennsylvania Station
at precisely nine-seven gives you a feeling of confidence, a
sense that everything’s going to be all right. An illusion,
of course, but essential. A lot of bohemian marriages break
up just because they don’t have it there, stable and making
marriage seem stable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll nodded. “Something in that, maybe,” he
observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But dinner was announced, and they went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you find a house?” Mr. Carroll inquired after a
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Phil. “I’m awfully pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll fairly snorted. “Stacey, I’m ashamed of
you!” he cried. “Blair can’t live in a hovel like that. He
can’t surround his children with all that coal-dust and
noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give you my word, Mr. Carroll,” Phil protested, “that
it’s a lot better than where we’ve been living. I really like
the place. I can run a lawn-mower in the evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the older man shook his head impatiently. “Now
look here!” he said. “This house of mine is three times
too big for Stacey and me, especially since Julie married.
You bring your wife and children here to live—anyway
until you can find something really decent or build if you
decide to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Blair flushed slightly. “I never heard of anything
quite so generous as that, sir,” he replied, a trifle unsteadily,
“but I can’t possibly accept.” And there was a gentle decision
in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, well! I’d have been glad to have you,” said
Mr. Carroll, and dropped the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey recognized that his father’s offer was more than
ordinarily generous, especially since Mr. Carroll liked to
lead his own life. And he would have lived up to it, Stacey
knew. He would have tried to crush Phil’s opinions into
the mold of his own and he would certainly have been
cross if Phil or Catherine were late at meals or showed
Bolshevik leanings, but in his own way, and with externals,
he would have been both impetuously and consistently generous.
He would probably even have given Phil a key to
the wine-cellar. All this Stacey understood, and with it
his father. But his understanding was intellectual. He
should have felt a warm glow, but he did not. The only
emotion he felt was a faint sadness at feeling nothing.
“Dead!” he muttered to himself. “Dead as they make
’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he would not really have chosen to feel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At coffee time a friend of Mr. Carroll’s dropped in to
play pinochle, and Phil and Stacey went upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey was restless. He wanted to see Marian and
resented the desire—another bond that he could not shake
free of. Moreover, he knew that in Marian’s presence
he should dislike her. So the endurance of the desire was
doubly exasperating. All this lack of harmony—even of
common sense!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll go over to see Marian Latimer,” he said at
last to Phil. “Be glad to have you come along. Really,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” returned Phil, “no. I’m a bit fagged. Quite
sincere about it. Run along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find out first whether she’s in,” Stacey said, and
lifted the receiver of the telephone on his desk. They were
in his study. “If she isn’t I’ll go to a movie,” he added,
while waiting for his number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got the house and, after a minute, Marian. She
laughed musically in response to his question. “Why, yes,
come! Do come!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her laughter made him angry—but not with her, with
himself. It was not her recognition of her power over him
that he minded. It was that power itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked to her house—a matter of a mile. He never
used a motor car nowadays if he could get anywhere without
one. Swift walking calmed the persistent fever of his
blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Latimer were in the drawing-room, and he
stood there for a few minutes, chatting with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marian is in the library,” said Mr. Latimer presently.
“She left word that you were to go up as soon as you
came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ames Price is there, too,” Mrs. Latimer put in quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Stacey, with apparent equanimity.
“Thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he saw Mr. Latimer flash a sudden glance of anger
at his wife, who, however, went on with her knitting calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s the way the land lies,” Stacey reflected, as he
climbed the stairs. “Papa has been told, or, more likely,
has found out. Decent of Mrs. Latimer, very!” Nevertheless,
he was unhappy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked at the library door, and Marian called to him
to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was curled up in her favorite arm-chair, and Ames
Price was rising from a smaller chair near-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian gave Stacey a look of mischievous defiance. But
he went over and shook hands with her so pleasantly and
coolly that her eyes grew suddenly puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Ames,” he said then, shaking his rival’s hand.
“Haven’t seen you for years. How’ve you been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First-class!” replied the other, eyeing Stacey doubtfully.
“You look pretty fit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a tall, fair, loosely built man of forty, smooth-shaven
and slightly bald. Stacey had known him in a casual
way for years, but all that he really knew about him was
that he had inherited money, had managed it well enough,
was said to be a bit fast—but not excessively, and played an
admirable game of golf. So far as Stacey or any one else
was aware, there had been (except for golf) no passions in
Ames’s life. Stacey felt a little sorry for him, that he should
have been overwhelmed now by this one. Marian would
make him uncomfortable. She would demand a great variety
of emotions of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, in spite of himself, Stacey also felt a hot jealousy.
By Jove, Marian <span class='it'>was</span> beautiful!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” said Ames, with proper politeness, “that you
must have had a pretty rough time in France. You were
over the deuce of a while. I didn’t get across myself—division
just about to sail when the Armistice came along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a touch of constraint in his tone. Stacey
understood it at once. It was as though Ames had said:
“You come back a hero. What chance have I got
against you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well,” Stacey returned, pleasantly enough, “that’s
all done with now. Here we all are again. There’s no
change in anything, really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at Marian. She was surveying the situation
distantly, with a faint amused smile. Stacey’s own sensations
beneath his calm demeanor were turbulent and mixed.
He desired Marian keenly, hated to let her go, yet felt an
antagonism for her that his desire increased rather than
diminished. He was jealous of Ames, yet not in the least
hostile toward him,—almost kindly, in fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to build houses again?” Ames asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey considered him for a moment, then Marian, and in
that moment wrenched himself free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “I believe I’ll go away—travel. Funny
thing, but a long stretch of the war-stuff turns a man into a
rather solitary animal. Maybe it’s the noise of the guns
that’s shut him off for so long from companionship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not really thinking, except vaguely, of leaving
Vernon, and had spoken principally to reassure Ames; for
which uncharacteristically benevolent act he was immediately
rewarded. The other man’s face relaxed from
anxiety into an expression so blissful as to be silly. In spite
of his conflicting emotions, Stacey could hardly keep from
laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall all be awfully sorry to have you go, Stacey,”
said Marian gently. “I shall, especially.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This might be directed at Ames (Marian was certain to
spend a great deal of time in hurting Ames), but Stacey did
not think it was. For it was a simple remark, simply
phrased. And Marian sat there, quiet, carved, thinking no
doubt that Stacey liked her best that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long he rose to go. He would have liked to remain
and look at Marian, but he had a well developed sense of
fair play. Let Ames be happy! And deeper than this was
the feeling that since he, Stacey, had decided for freedom he
had better begin to act on the decision at once. That was it—act!
do something! It was the only release from
everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he rose Marian rose too, and accompanied him
out into the hall, and closed the door behind her. Ames did
not seem to mind. When Marian excused herself his rather
vacuous face was as radiant as before. What more natural
than that a girl should find it fitting to say good-bye to an
outgrown lover of her early youth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ames would not, perhaps, have been so calm about it
had he witnessed the setting and details. For outside the
door Marian paused only for an instant to look up at Stacey,
then, with a gesture of her hand to him, hurried down the
hall a few yards, stopped abruptly at a door that opened off
from it, turned the knob gently, and, giving first one swift
glance up and down the hall, pulled Stacey a little way into
the room beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed around him quickly. There was no light save
that which came from the hall. It was Marian’s bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned on her and seized her wrists, his heart beating
violently. But his hostility rose, wave for wave, with his
passion. What a trick to play on him! Deliberate!
Deliberate!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she stood there, close to him, perfectly still, looking
up into his eyes. The corners of her mouth trembled
a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They kissed, madly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Stacey,” she murmured faintly, when he had
released her. “Don’t think I was—trying to hold you. I
wasn’t. I only wanted to say good-bye—like this. I think
you’re—right—and I won’t hate you—any more than I can
help. Good-bye!” And, with another swift glance up and
down, she drew him back into the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when she was already half way to the library door she
turned and came back a step or two. Her eyes were wet,
but her mouth had curved into a mischievous smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Ames!” she said, and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey managed to leave the house without seeing either
Mr. or Mrs. Latimer. He walked away swiftly. And
when the confusion of his senses wore off he began to see
into things a little more deeply than before. He saw his
feeling toward Marian as it really was and as, he perceived,
Marian had understood it—animal desire and love of beauty.
Desire was a bond. It hurt to have it go. Stacey felt a
painful emptiness, as though he had torn something violently
from his heart. Yet he also felt a kind of exultation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Life in Vernon went on and on, and Stacey watched it proceed.
But his attitude remained one of scornful indifference
through which flickered occasional gleams of sudden eager
interest, anger or hate. The perception of greed was one
of the things that stirred him most frequently, and it grew
within him until it amounted almost to a fixed idea. His
hatred of money, its symbol, became fanatical. He would
have renounced his own income entirely, except that he did
not want to throw himself into the mêlée just yet, but somehow
to see things through from outside—though through to
where, he could not have said. As it was, he retained two
hundred dollars a month and sent the rest to the relief fund
for Viennese children. In this he was making no effort to
live up to a principle, to conform himself to some ideal of
life; if he had been, he would have sent all. He was, almost
solely, striving for freedom from something he hated. Not
quite solely, however, or why did he make this particular
disposition of the money? He refused to answer the question.
He would be free from what he loved as well as from
what he hated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One carefully covered-up aspect of life in Vernon did
interest Stacey. Existence there <span class='it'>seemed</span> the same as formerly,
people thought it was—though perhaps a few of
them only pretended to think so; but at bottom certain fundamental
relationships were shaken. Men paid eighteen
dollars for a pair of shoes for which five years back they
would have paid seven, or, not buying them, would next day
have to pay twenty-three; women would offer sixty dollars
a month for a maid, then not get her. The majority said
that the cost of living was outrageous and servants scarce,
and went superbly on as before. But Stacey grinned at
them malignantly. He stamped on the ground and heard a
hollow sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, although by this time his father talked to him
almost with constraint and gave him often a wistful puzzled
glance, Stacey himself felt a juster appreciation of his father
than at first. Mr. Carroll was partizan down to the tips of
his toes, but he did know that more was abroad than mere
surface changes. His angry thought of Bolshevism was an
obsession. And, knowing his father’s nature to be kindly
and impulsive, Stacey gave him credit for something more
than the mere desire to hold what he had got,—which Stacey
thought he discerned beneath the vehemence of most perturbed
capitalists—Colin Jeffries, for instance. No, Mr.
Carroll was in arms for principles he believed in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Stacey, he neither believed in them nor in those
that opposed them. It was unfortunate. He would have
been much happier if he could have thrown himself actively
into the fray on one side or the other. Not because he
craved human association; he did not. He was singularly
solitary and aloof—with a white-hot kind of aloofness.
But because he craved action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was strike after strike of labor in Vernon. They
became almost the only subject of conversation. Even
women discussed them, at teas or in their electrics as they
drove to the movies. There was no coal for a while; then
the workmen in all the mills struck; then the river dock-hands
went out, and were promptly joined by the truck and
dray men. This last strike tied up nearly everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was interested. He walked down to strike headquarters
one afternoon and faced one of the sullen groups
of men gathered in the dishevelled yard before the low brick
building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it you fellows want?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There ensued a rumble of hostile voices and some
sharp cries. “Beat it, you bum!” “Get to hell out of here,
you damned aristocrat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, shut up! I want to know,” Stacey said impatiently.
“You must have some idea about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rumble became a roar, a man struck out at Stacey,
and Stacey promptly knocked him down. There was a
general mix-up during which Stacey was surprised to find a
man—one of the laborers, so far as he had time to see—fighting
efficiently on his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The police, who must have been close-at-hand, presently
smashed up the affray and rescued the two, whereupon
Stacey, rather battered, but happier than he had been for a
long while, swung about to investigate his comrade-in-arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the Lord! Burnham!” he cried, with real pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same, Captain,” said the other, instinctively raising
his hand in salute, then dropping it again awkwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey seized the hand and wrung it. Burnham had
been first sergeant in one of his two companies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey gave his name to the police, observed that he was
much obliged but that there was nothing to make a fuss
about, and walked away with Burnham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite like old times, eh?” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, this!” said Burnham, and spat scornfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing up here?” Stacey demanded.
“Thought you lived in Omaha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I did. And my wife and kids are still there with
my wife’s sister. But I heard there was good work with
better pay up here, so I come up to see, and I was drivin’ a
truck, and then the boys went out—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, look here!” cried Stacey. “Then you were one of
them! I swear I’m sorry! This will put you in bad with
the others, won’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burnham grinned. “They won’t exactly be coming
around and begging me to have another drink of ginger extract
on them,” he admitted. “It don’t matter, Captain,
honest it don’t! I was going back to Omaha anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey stopped walking and stared at him curiously.
“Why on earth did you side with me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno,” said the other, looking down and shuffling
with his feet on the sidewalk. “Habit, I guess. No,” he
added, looking Stacey in the eye, while a dull flush spread
over his face, “no, it ain’t that. I’d go anywhere you went,
Captain, even if it was straight to hell. Pshaw, hell would
be a song compared with some of the places I’ve gone
with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was touched and also disturbed. What a responsibility!
Here was a bond with a vengeance!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m blessed if I know why,” he murmured, and they
walked on. “And yet,” he exclaimed suddenly, “you’ve been
here in Vernon for I don’t know how long and haven’t even
come to see me! Is hell the only place you’ll accompany
me to? Have you got a special preference for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burnham hung his head. “Well, you see,” he muttered,
“you’re such a confounded swell up here, Captain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey again paused abruptly and turned on the man.
“Damn you, Burnham, I’m not!” he cried. “What do you
say that for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Burnham apologetically, “maybe you don’t
want to be, maybe you ain’t, but I guess you’ll have a hell
of a time not to be. Looks to me like every one’s gone back
the way they was before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey felt profoundly discouraged, the comment was so
obviously true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that what the men down there had against me?”
he inquired almost humbly, walking on once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” Burnham assented. “The boys are all right, but
they’re touchy. And you blow in, not meaning any harm—but
they didn’t know that, not knowing you like I know you—and
you ask them what the matter is, like a man giving
orders, and they get sore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sullen anger with himself crept over Stacey. It was all
true enough. He <span class='it'>had</span> spoken to the men crisply, like one in
authority. There was no use in explaining to them, or even
to Burnham, that this was not because he was a Vernon
Carroll but because he could not rid himself of the military
habit of command in word and thought. There was no use
in explaining anything to anybody. Bonds? He was tied
hand and foot with them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” he asked quietly, “what <span class='it'>is</span> it they want,
Burnham?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re getting seventy cents an hour—my crowd, I
mean. They want eighty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They continued, in silence, until at last they reached the
Carroll house. Burnham paused to look up at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some place, Captain!” he observed appreciatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I—I’ve been by here before,” said Burnham
sheepishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’ve been by here before, have you?” Stacey returned
sharply. “Well, you’re not going by this time.
You’re coming in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, now listen, Captain! I’m going to take the ten <span class='sc'>P.M.</span>
for Omaha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can start for it from here as well as from anywhere
else. Come now! March!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Newspaper reporters were ringing Stacey insistently on
the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” he answered. “Nothing to it. Went down to
strike headquarters to ask silly questions, and got into a
baby fracas, as I deserved to. No casualties. No, I can’t
tell you any more. There isn’t any more to tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Burnham up to his study and made him sit down.
“Now I tell you what we’ll do,” he said. “About nine-fifteen
or so we’ll drive around to your boarding-house or wherever
it is you’ve been living and pick up your things—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burnham was grinning. “Gee, Captain, you’re innocent,
considering what kind of things you’ve been through!” he
interrupted. “D’you think after what’s happened that I’d
find any of my stuff there? I’d find a bunch of the boys
waiting to beat me up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Stacey. And, paying no heed to Burnham’s
embarrassed protestations, he pulled a travelling-bag from a
closet and packed it. “Oh, shut up!” he said finally. “Go
into the bath-room there and wash. You’re even dirtier
than I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the door of the study was thrown open and Mr.
Carroll hurried in, red-faced and out of breath. “I’ve just
heard,” he panted. “Did those damned scoundrels do
you any—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sh!” said Stacey, raising his finger to his lip, as Burnham
came out of the bath-room. “Father, this is Burnham,
my first sergeant—C Company—and as good a man as I’ve
run up against. Incidentally, though he’s one of the boys
who’re striking, he turned in and fought them with me this
afternoon. Whole thing very silly. Neither of us hurt at
all. Burnham will stay to dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll looked at Burnham keenly and held out his
hand. “I’m glad to know you, Sergeant,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>American Legion Veteran Attacked By Strikers!</span>” announced
the newspaper headlines next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The striking dock and dray men added another outrage
to their intolerable behavior when they yesterday violently
attacked former Captain Stacey Carroll, D.S.C., a hero of</span>
<span class='it'>numerous battles in the late World War and son of Edward
H. Carroll of this city. Captain Carroll had gone to strike
headquarters at 13 Plumb Street at about five o’clock yesterday
afternoon in a generous attempt to learn the men’s side
of the case. His friendly questions, however, were met by a
brutal assault. This time, however, the strikers mistook
their man, and the only result of the attempted outrage is
that Michael Dennis (24) has a broken nose, Vladimir Sarovitch
(20) a black and blue facial coloring that improves
his former appearance, while Lorenzo Cecchi (21) is in the
City Hospital with a fractured wrist. The public will be relieved
to learn that Captain Carroll is uninjured except for a
few superficial bruises. Dennis and Sarovitch were arrested
on a charge of assault and battery but were promptly released
on bail, money, as is well known, being plentiful at
strike headquarters.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>This brutal and uncalled-for assault upon a hero of the
World War marks</span>” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was infuriated. He wrote a sharp fetter to the
paper, then, with grudging common sense, tore it up and
wrote another milder one in which he protested that the
whole affair was due to a misunderstanding and was anyway
too unimportant to deserve mention in the press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the hospital to see Cecchi, a handsome dark-haired
Neapolitan who stared at him angrily at first out of
immense black eyes till Stacey apologized to him in Italian,
after which the two conversed in that language with an increasing
good humor that was heightened by their puzzled
pauses over Stacey’s mistakes and Cecchi’s dialect. The
interview put them almost on terms of intimacy. Stacey
gave the Neapolitan, who had fought in the Battle of the
Piave, some Austrian bank-notes printed in Italian for use
in Venetia during the invasion, and Cecchi responded with a
tiny silver medal of the Madonna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Accidenti alla stampa!</span>” (damn newspapers!) they agreed
heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey’s pleasant frame of mind on leaving the hospital
was destroyed by his glimpse of the morning paper’s
noon edition. His letter was there, but ruined by the caption
above: “<span class='it'>Captain Carroll’s Generous Reply—Makes
Light of Cowardly Attack—Would Exonerate Strikers</span>,”
and by the fulsome eulogy of his behavior that followed. A
vibrant editorial completed the wreck, insisting that while
the personal magnanimity shown in Captain Carroll’s letter
must appeal to every red-blooded citizen, the time had at
last come when law and order must be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without the slightest desire to align himself either on one
side or the other, save that he felt a little more personal
sympathy with the strikers, who anyway lived in touch with
the few realities of life, than with their opponents, Stacey
saw himself established irremediably as a Saint-George-like
champion of law and order. He damned the press more
earnestly than before. He lunched at the club with his
father, whose eyes shone with approval of him, and he had,
moreover, to undergo an ordeal of praise and congratulation
from his father’s friends, together with briefer, less intense
words from men of his own age. (The younger men, he
told himself, were anyhow less grandiloquent nowadays
than the older, though perhaps this was only because they
<span class='it'>were</span> younger). Once or twice he tried impatiently to explain
the silly business as it really was, but unavailingly.
Anything he said was taken, he saw, as merely a further
proof of his generosity. He gave up the attempt sulkily.
Clearly his position was fixed. People had made up their
minds about him, his reputation was solidly established, and
nothing he might henceforth do could affect it. It struck
him that the levity with which people acquired convictions
would be ghastly if it were not so ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deserting the club with a feeling of relief, he wandered
aimlessly about the city. But toward five o’clock, being
caught in a sudden rain-shower, he took refuge in Philip
Blair’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, there were other houses closer-by
that would have afforded shelter, and it was at least partly
from preference that he chose this one. He had not regained
his old warm affection for Phil and Catherine, but
their society was like a temporary balm applied to his
fevered restless mind. No touch of greed was in them.
They were, Stacey concluded, hardly human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil had not yet returned from the office, but Catherine
was at home with her two sons—Carter, now nine years old,
and Jack, who was seven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She welcomed him with her pleasant smile, that was like
light shining coolly through an alabaster bowl, but also with
characteristic constraint. She was only perfectly at ease
with him when Phil, too, was present and less demand for
expression was thus put upon her. “Shy,” thought Stacey
once again. “Shy as Truth herself!” But he did not mind
her shyness; he liked it. Being with Catherine was like
bathing in a bottomless pool of clear translucent water.
Fancies such as this, resembling those among which he had
formerly lived so familiarly, came to him now only when he
was with the Blairs. The fact should have revealed to him
much that was obscure in himself; but it did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no constraint in Carter’s and Jack’s greetings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Stacey,” cried Carter immediately, “I got A in
arithmetic on my report in New York and A in reading and
B-Plus in spelling!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s good,” said Stacey. “What did you get in
conduct?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“C-Plus,” said Carter in a small voice. But his depression
did not last long. “Uncle Stacey,” he exclaimed, “do
‘Fly away, Jack! Fly away, Jill!’ for him.” He pointed to
his brother. “I bet he can’t guess the secret! I bet he’ll
look all over the room for them!” And Carter grinned a
delighted toothless grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” observed Stacey, obediently making the necessary
preparations, “I remember some one else who looked all
over the room for them a few years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you mean me,” Carter replied. “Well, I guess I
did. I guess I was awful stupid maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carter,” said his mother, with a laugh, “there aren’t
that many ‘guesses’ in the whole dictionary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Phil arrived. He looked tired with the heat,
but his thin face brightened when he saw Stacey there playing
with the boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey, you’re a fraud!” he said. “What sort of behavior
is this for a misanthrope? You ought to be gloating
over what Jack and Carter will grow up to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine put an end to the game and sent the boys out
to play on the porch. “Yes,” she said, as she closed the door
upon them, “I guess Stacey doesn’t mean all he says. I
guess he’s really kind-hearted. I guess he likes children,
maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil stared at his wife and smiled. “For heaven’s sake,
Catherine,” he demanded, “what’s come over your English?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “Corrupting effect of Carter,” he explained.
“Yes, of course I like children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like to have some of your own?” Phil asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey reflected, frowning. “Yes,” he replied at last, “I
think so. Just one, a boy, so that I could try bringing
him up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil and Catherine both laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word,” said the former, “this is delightful!
Fancy finding you not merely humanly usual but positively
universal—a bachelor with theories on education! What is
your present theory, my son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled. However, it had become difficult for him
to smile, and when he did so his face took on uneasy lines.
He was not at his best when smiling. He was at his best
when his face remained impassive and soldierly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he said drily, “it’s a romantic enough theory, quite
Rousseau-like. I’ve just invented it this minute. If I had a
son I should take him to live in the country, in some place
where the landscape was neither too grand, and thus apt to
arouse vast disturbing aspirations in him, nor yet ignominious
and depressing, like these dingy middle-western plains.
I would have him live among trees, that are handsome and
do no harm, and associate familiarly with a great many
kindly simple-minded animals such as dogs, cows and
horses, with a few cultivated elegant animals such as cats,
and—less frequently and intimately—with one or two goats,
who are old, sophisticated and skeptical, the <span class='it'>libres penseurs</span>
among animals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with no humans at all, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Stacey dubiously, “perhaps now and then
an occasional, very choice human, such as you or Catherine,
just to show him what human beings <span class='it'>can</span> become,—but
rarely, Phil, rarely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, from Catherine and myself,” Phil observed,
with a rather weary smile, “but I’d rather you’d select some
one else. I should be profoundly unwilling to pose as an
example.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I!” echoed Catherine. “Besides, I shouldn’t have
time. I should have to be getting dinner for Phil and the
boys—just as I must do now.” And she rose. “I’ve not
been able to find a maid yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey, considering Catherine and Phil, perceived,
with a softening touch of sympathy, that they were both
very tired and that no doubt he had been adding to their
fatigue. These two lived with a life of their own, apart,
serene, modestly adding their few grains of pure gold to that
appallingly small treasure which represented the sole remainder
of all these ages and ages of human existence. Yet
because they did so, thought Stacey, because they were clear
pin-points of light in chaos, all life was against them, chillingly
indifferent where not actively hostile. The blackness
swirled about with a malignant, dully sentient desire to
engulf and extinguish them. They were repaid for their
foolhardy torch-bearing, their unforgivable sin of having
some meaning, by being ground down beneath the sordid
difficulties of bare existence. Ames Price, who played golf,
or Jimmy Prout, who tried law suits, or Colin Jeffries, who
handled a dozen corporations of no value to life, had carpets
unrolled obsequiously before them as they walked; while
Phil must wear his genius frayed on hack labor and Catherine
must cook for her family in a small hot kitchen. “What
a brute of a world! What an ugly perverse mess of a
world!” thought Stacey, with a fierce sick disgust. Worth
nothing! Its hard won treasure was too tiny to justify such
a colossal grovelling incoherence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while Stacey was reflecting moodily in this manner
Catherine had gone into the kitchen. Stacey could hear
her there, moving pots and pans. Suddenly he sprang up
and went out after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Catherine!” he said. “It’s too hot to cook
this evening! Come on out with me. We’ll all go and have
dinner at a chop-suey place. The boys, too, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him doubtfully for just a moment, then
smiled. “Thank you, Stacey,” she said simply. “That will
be awfully pleasant. I think Phil is pretty tired. I’ll go and
get the boys ready.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey and Mrs. Latimer were having tea together. But,
since Stacey had ceased to visit the Latimer home, they were
having it at the “Sign of the Purple Parrot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a small but expensive tea-room recently opened
on the fifth floor of a building close to the river front, and
Stacey, as he entered it (for the first time), glanced swiftly
about at its white walls, low white ceiling, small-paned windows
with hangings of purple-figured cretonne, and at the
purple wooden parrot on a tall standard in the centre of the
room. A silver vase containing a single yellow rose decorated
each of the ten or twelve little tables. Finally Stacey
turned in mute amazement to his companion, since it was
she who had suggested the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have very good tea,” she said, with an amused
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Miss Wilcox, proprietor of the tea-room, advanced
toward them. “I’m so glad you’ve come early,
before any one else, Mrs. Latimer,” she said, “because you
can have one of the two tables out on the balcony. I’m sure
you’d like that. They’re always the first to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And accordingly they went outside and sat down in wicker
chairs beneath a purple and white awning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think it’s a nice idea,” asked Miss Wilcox,
standing near them, “to try and use our river esthetically,
Captain Carroll? It <span class='it'>is</span> Captain Carroll, isn’t it? I recognized
you from your photograph. We’re honored to have
you come. It seems such a shame to have this magnificent
river and then use it solely for ugly business purposes. But
that’s so often true in America, I think. Saint Louis is the
same way. I should so like to have my modest little effort
followed by others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey said politely that he hoped it would be, and Miss
Wilcox presently moved away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t mind her, poor thing!” Mrs. Latimer observed
kindly. “She’s devoted to her institution. It’s her
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Preposterous virgin birth!” murmured Stacey, gazing
down at the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It sweltered in the intense August sunlight. Barges and
tugs moved up and down its sallow waters, and vast warehouses
flanked it. Across on the further side was a train
yard with multitudes of red freight cars, idle or with engines
shunting them about. Trucks and drays rattled over
the cobble stones of the streets leading down to the river
(the strike having been settled some weeks since), and
shouts rose and the odor of grease. And Stacey, turning
away from it to order tea and scones from a capped and
aproned maid who had come to his side, looked at her as
though he did not believe in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A movie world, Mrs. Latimer,” he remarked finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “it is silly, isn’t it? This painted parrot,
and the tea roses, and the tiny, fussy, white-and-purple
room, trying to make itself noticed by that immense fierce
reality out there! But it doesn’t do any harm, and I thought
the incongruity of it might amuse you. Where has your
sense of humor gone, Stacey? Once you would have
laughed gaily at this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does a china tea-cup go in an earthquake?” he
responded absently, looking down again at the river, then
back at the room. “No, of course there’s no harm in it,”
he said, after a moment, “since it is so obviously absurd,
but you might, I suppose, take it as a fantastic caricature of
something—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Miss Wilcox was seating people at the other table
of the balcony. “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so often true in America, I think,”
she was saying. “I <span class='it'>should</span> like to have my modest little
effort followed by others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer smiled, but Stacey did not. He waited impassively
until Miss Wilcox had finished speaking and had
walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now in the movies,” he continued, “you are presented
with standards of behavior—sweetness and light, purity
unsoiled, virtue triumphant, best of all possible worlds—that
have nothing to do with real life. Seems impossible
that real men and women could have posed for the pictures.
You’d think the contrast with the promiscuity of their actual
California divorce-court lives would be too strong. Not a
bit of it! Well, that’s all right—if people like that kind of
thing. Personally, I think it’s sickening. No matter how
abominable real life is, I’d a thousand times rather have to
live in it than in a Pollyanna, Mary Pickford, glad-and-tender
world! Faugh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So should I,” said Mrs. Latimer. “But if weary people
find release in such tawdry fairy-tales—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! Let them! Nobody’s business! But there’s the
trouble. The silly stuff isn’t just taken as release. It gets
accepted as truth. I mean to say, the ideals and standards
are taken as those of real people. How in heaven’s name
they can be by any member of a movie audience who knows
anything about himself, I swear I can’t imagine, but
they are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but that’s the point!” said Mrs. Latimer gently.
“They don’t know themselves. Even you don’t know yourself,
Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know enough about myself to see that I’m not like
that. And what results? That any glimpse of truth is condemned
as rotten, abnormal, pathological. For the movies
are only a glowing example of a spirit that corrupts everything.
Why, if a novelist were to take any man alive—I
don’t say me, but somebody better—Jimmy Prout, for instance—and
tell the whole truth about him, the ghastly
things he did and the ghastlier ones he wanted to do but
didn’t dare, what a row there’d be! The reviewers would
call the book abominable, the hero a hopeless rotter, though
every one of them has done or wanted to do things just as
bad. A movie world, Mrs. Latimer! No truth in it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “no doubt. I’d like it different, honester.
But what harm does the pretence do? It even sets a standard
of a sort, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What harm?” he cried. “Why, it makes people shocked
at German atrocities, as though they were sins committed
by some alien inhuman monsters. Down with Prussianism?
As much as you like! I’m glad we beat the Germans. So
far, so good. But how about the Prussianism in ourselves?
A movie world! A smug, lying, movie world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is kindliness in it, too,” she said wistfully,
“and generosity. I’ve met them both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Stacey assented somberly, “there is—in sudden
impulses, more frequent, I’ll even concede, than these passing
gusts of bestiality. But, so far as I can see, there’s
only one real force, one motive, in life, that stays on and on
and never dies. Greed!” he concluded fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer gazed at him for a moment in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And still you don’t see it all,” she said at last very
gently. “You won’t look deeply enough into yourself. If
you did you’d see the splendid spectacle of the human soul
fighting all this that you describe—and without quarter,
dear Stacey, as long as you have breath in you. Has your
hatred of greed and lies no significance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” he replied, drawing his hand across his
forehead. “And I don’t see that I’m doing any splendid
fighting. I don’t know what to fight. I merely fume impotently.”
But the wild look of pain had disappeared from
his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell to wondering about his companion. No optimist,
surely. Doubtful of most things, but sweet and mellow in
her skepticism. How had she attained such serenity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must know Catherine, my friend Philip Blair’s
wife,” he said suddenly. “You will like her, and she you.
There’s truth in the hearts of both of you, and yet you’re
different, somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you do say pretty things, they’re pleasant to hear,
Stacey,” Mrs. Latimer replied, with a faint girlish blush,
“because you seem not ever to be saying them for effect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they rose to go. Neither of them had so much as
alluded to the fact that Marian was to be married to Ames
Price in a few weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same evening Stacey attended a meeting of the
American Legion. His life was like that now, inconsequential.
He went pointlessly from one unrelated fact to
another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being in a far from constructive frame of mind, he had
nothing against the Legion and nothing in favor of it. It
had indeed occurred to him that if an organization founded
on no common conviction, but on the mere fact that its
members had all been in the army, should come to exert
political influence, that influence would certainly be confusing
and might be harmful; on the contrary, if the young
men who had been soldiers wanted to play together, why
not? But these were idle thoughts. At heart he did not
care one way or the other about the Legion. If he had
shown more interest he might perhaps, in view of his record,
have been elected commander of the post; but this is doubtful.
He was a wealthy son of a wealthy father, and class
antagonisms were not absent from the Legion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to now he had attended only one meeting, but he had
learned that to-night a protest was to be presented against
the engagement of Fritz Kreisler to play in Vernon in the
coming autumn; and Stacey, disgusted, was out to see if
there was anything he could do to head off such nonsense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a full meeting. There were several hundred men
in the large hall when Stacey entered, and tobacco smoke
hung over them in a dull blue mist. The commander of the
post was already in the chair, and the business of reading
minutes was under way. Stacey dropped into a seat and
waited abstractedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not have long to wait. Excitement buzzed in a
group near the centre of the room, and a young captain
sprang up. Stacey knew him by sight. His unit was that
to which Jimmy Prout had belonged. It had never left
Camp Grant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Commander and Comrades!” he began tensely.
“You know what I want to say. It’s about this business
of letting an enemy come here and take our money, just as
if nothing had ever happened. You know who I mean. I
mean Kreisler. Kreisler was our enemy in the war. It
doesn’t make any difference that he didn’t happen to fight
against Americans or that he was out of it before we went
in. He was on the wrong side. He supported the side that
did all the—the atrocities you know about. And what I
want to say is that if we’re asked to give him our support
and our money it’s an outrage. And so,” he added, unfolding
a paper, “I propose the following motion:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We, the members of the John Harton Post of the American
Legion, hereby express our amazement and strong disapproval
of the action of the manager of the Park Street
Theatre in engaging Fritz Kreisler, recently a soldier in
the Austrian army, to play at a concert in the city of Vernon
less than one year after the conclusion of a great war during
which thousands of American lives were sacrificed to defeat
the very principles that Herr Kreisler supported. And we
hereby request the manager of said theatre to cancel Herr
Kreisler’s engagement, and notify him that failure to do so
will result in an attitude of marked disinclination to patronize
said theatre on the part of the members of this post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the young captain sat down amid applause, during
which half a dozen voices seconded the motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there any remarks?” asked the chairman calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was smiling a little at the contrast between the
phraseology of the introduction and that of the motion, but,
half risen in his seat, he was also looking about him keenly.
It did not strike him that the tensity was universal. There
were sluggish centres of indifference in the hall, and not
many remarks were being made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he rose to his feet, obtained recognition, and
made his way to the front of the room amid some considerable
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite agree with Captain Small,” he said, leaning
against the chairman’s desk, “that it doesn’t make any difference
that Kreisler was an Austrian instead of a German,
and that the unit in which he fought never faced an American
unit. Aside from that, I disagree with him in everything. It
strikes me that for this post to pass any such motion as that
proposed would be silly. Kreisler fought against us? Well,
what of it? So did a lot of other good men. If we don’t
admit that we depreciate our own achievement. Gentlemen,
I call to your attention the advice given some months since
by a newspaper in Rome. ‘There are a large number of
people sitting in a large number of offices, and especially
those who never saw service at the front,’ this paper said,
‘who ought to be made to write: <span class='it'>The war is over! The war
is over!</span> twenty times a day until they get the fact into their
heads’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a murmur of laughter; but Captain Small was
on his feet, protesting angrily. “Mr. Commander!” he
cried, “I object to the insinuation that Captain Carroll has
made—I mean to say, that I never saw active service. If I
didn’t it wasn’t my fault, and I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chairman rapped with his gavel. “I am sure Captain
Carroll intended no such suggestion,” he observed. “Go
on, Captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not,” said Stacey coolly. “It was through no
fault of Captain Small’s that he did not get to France. He
was, I believe, one of the first to volunteer upon America’s
entry into the war. But, having made that perfectly clear,
and since the point has arisen, I call it to your attention that
both the proposer of this motion and those who seconded it
happen to be men who, though through no fault of their
own, did not see fighting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rumble of voices interrupted him, but he waved his
hand for silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute! Let me finish! I say this not to create
dissension, but because I want to show that I’m speaking
not just for myself but for the point of view of the men
who had the luck—good or bad—to fight the Germans in
Flanders and the Argonne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned forward and scrutinized the faces of the audience
swiftly. There was something compelling in his presence.
Undoubtedly he dominated the crowd, even against
their will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You Franck!” he called sharply. “Are you against letting
Kreisler play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-naw!” stammered the man addressed, startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Davies? You, Markovitch? You, Einstein?
Jones? Thorburtson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!”—“No!”—shakes of the head—negatives all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bruce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jesus Christ! no, Captain! Let him play and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laughter broke out tumultuously, and the chairman
pounded with his gavel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all,” said Stacey, and sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said the commander, when silence had been
partly restored, “that it would be unfortunate to divide this
organization up into those who saw fighting and those who
did not. We should stick together in everything.” But
his words were perfunctory. He had been severely wounded
at Les Eparges. “All in favor of the motion signify by
saying Aye. Opposed, No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The motion was lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had won. But he was under no illusions. He had
won by force, and he had made more enemies than friends.
When he left the hall at the end of the meeting he was a
solitary figure at whom men looked from a distance. He
did not care. He preferred his solitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But outside, at the foot of the steps, Edwards, the commander,
caught up with him and limped off beside him. He
was a mechanic and a student, self-educated, and popular
with labor. In high quarters he was solemnly suspected of
being a socialist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you said was right enough, Carroll,” he observed
meditatively. “The trouble was with the way you said it.
Too much outside. Too harsh and scornful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite true,” Stacey assented. “That happens to be the
way I personally am—harsh and scornful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards shook his head. “You saw too much of it, I
guess, Carroll,” he remarked. “Four whole years, wasn’t
it? God in heaven! And more mud than we ever saw.
Years more of mud! Filthy thing, the war, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed shortly. “Wait twenty years and see how
people talk about it,” he said. “Banners waving! Steel-capped
heroes! Glory! Glory! We’ll be talking that way,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked on in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, by the way, Edwards,” said Stacey suddenly, “you’re
a labor man. I wish to God you’d set me right about that
strike business. The thing was too silly the way it got into
those rotten papers. I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards was laughing quietly. “Pshaw!” he interrupted.
“Do you think we don’t know the facts? That’s one thing
we do know. The boys aren’t down on you. They’re not
even down on Burnham now, though he did turn against
them. Can’t say that you’re personally popular—too harsh
and scornful, but you’re respected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s good,” said Stacey, with genuine relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to crawl through the needle’s eye and come in
with us,” Edwards added, after a moment. “I don’t believe
you give a damn for your money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do, though,—you labor people,” Stacey returned
coldly. “You’re out for all you can get, regardless. How
do you expect me to take sides either for or against you?
Greed on one hand, greed on the other. Everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saw too much of it, Carroll,” Edwards repeated. “Years
too much. ’Night. I turn down here.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Marian was married at Saint Grace’s early in September,
and Stacey was present at the wedding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of people looked at him curiously, for it was
known to some that he and the bride had formerly been
engaged; but they found nothing in Stacey’s face or bearing
to reward them. There was general interest in the wedding,
since Ames Price and Marian Latimer were both prominent;
there were no excited whispered comments. No gossip
linked Stacey’s name with Marian’s. And, indeed, it is
an odd fact that it was difficult for a man and still more
difficult for a woman to get talked about adversely in Vernon.
This was particularly true if they were socially prominent.
In that case they must do something almost publicly
scandalous, must literally be “asking for it.” Which unfortunately
does not signify that morals were any higher in
Vernon than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s sensations were as mixed as ever. He was able
to perceive the smooth elegance of the show, made up of
the flowers, the soft light creeping through the stained glass
windows of the handsome church, the rustling of costly
dresses, the low murmur of fashionable voices, the smiles,
the easy greetings, the ushers, and the discreet music of the
organ. And he was even able to note that, though Marian
was fetching enough to arouse at her appearance on her
father’s arm a sudden hum of admiration before silence fell
softly, she was not really at her best in that trailing lace-and-satin
wedding gown. No, she was more beautiful in a plain
tailor-made suit with a short skirt. She would have looked
best of all with her fair hair drawn back simply and bound
with a ribbon, bare armed, and with a kirtle falling only to
her knees. But beneath the surface calm of Stacey’s mind
fire smoldered. He was angrily stirred, angrily jealous; for
he had not freed himself completely from desire of Marian.
Had he, after all, been a fool to renounce her? he wondered.
He might have stood there by her side in Ames’s place. But
at this he caught himself up scornfully. What? he thought
brutally. Deliberately chain himself and her to a life of
hopeless incompatibility because he desired to possess this
girl’s beautiful body? Was the craving of his whole soul
for freedom less passionate than the mere craving of his
senses for satisfaction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Stacey! Contradictory, stormy, inharmonious!
Made up of dissonances. Repelled by Marian, yet desiring
her; avid of freedom, but avid, too, of hate—an enslaving
bond if ever there was one; more passionately and truly in
love with beauty than ever before, yet destructive of it in
himself; full of power with nowhere to direct it; hard and
bitter, yet honestly anguished by the pain in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ceremony over, he made his way out of the church as
quickly as possible, but paused for a moment on the sidewalk
to glance at the interminable line of handsome waiting
motor cars. The irony in their expensive patronage of one
of Christ’s churches made him suddenly smile. Then he
set off on foot for the Latimer house, where the reception
would be held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very well done, he thought,—adequate, handsome,—er—elegant,
without being vulgarly lavish; roses
enough, but not “bowers” of roses—though “bowers” was
what the paper next morning would say there had been;
champagne punch, but not tubs and pools of it; decent air of
gaiety, but no riot. Well, you could count on Mr. Latimer
to carry the thing off in the right way. It was what he was
for. Fifty-odd years of careful training, with never a moment
wasted, had fitted him for the task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey wondered what Mrs. Latimer thought about it all.
Oh, she would probably be as detached as always, humorously
but not unkindly amused by it. However, he had no
chance to find out. Mrs. Latimer was much too busy
receiving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His one real curiosity was to know how Marian would
look at him when, in the line, he shook her hand and Ames’s.
He decided that she would be candid, simple and virginal,
as became a bride, with no hint of anything in her greeting.
But he was wrong. He was unfair to Marian, fancying
her far more deliberate than she really was. The swift
look she gave him was strange and enigmatic, and stirred
him. There was a touch of defiance in it, as though she had
said: “Well, you would have it this way! Do you like what
you’ve done?” And he could not blame her if the words
she spoke were merely the proper words. There were people
all about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later he came upon his sister, Julie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Stacey,” she said, “why couldn’t you be nice and go
with me to the wedding? Jimmy’s out of town, so I went
all alone. I saw you across the church from me and thought
I’d pick you up afterward, but when I came out I couldn’t
find you anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled at the protective solicitude in her tone. “Oh,
well,” he returned, “I’ll drive back with you to your house
for a little chat when you’re ready to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ready now,” she said quickly, and they went out to
her electric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one else had ventured to make any comment to Stacey
when Marian’s engagement to Ames Price had been announced;
even Mr. Carroll had only looked at his son in an
odd puzzled way. But Julie had ventured. She had asserted
loyally that Stacey was much too good for Marian,
and that Marian didn’t care whom she married so long as
he had money. He had reflected at the time that, though
Julie simplified things down to bare essentials, it was essentials
that she selected. She was not unlike their father in
this, he thought. She returned to the subject now, as they
glided along the city streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care!” she broke out hotly. “I think she’s horrid!
Of course I know it must have been you who broke off the
engagement—now wasn’t it, Stacey? Why won’t you admit
it? Why, <span class='it'>anybody</span> would be <span class='it'>proud</span> to marry you!—but then
for her to go and marry a stupid person like Ames Price,
old enough to be her father, too, less than three months
later,—why, I think it’s cheap! That’s what Marian is—cheap!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed, amused at her desire to comfort him. He
enjoyed being with his sister; nor was there anything patronizing
in his feeling for her. He was not doing so admirably
with a complex mind that he could afford to look
comfortably down upon Julie for having a simple mind.
And she was not stupid. He thought she did rather well
with life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he observed, “Ames isn’t as old as all that! He’s
only forty or thereabouts. I’m almost thirty-five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he looks hundreds of years older—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Take care!” Stacey interrupted, stretching out
his hand toward the lever, as the car barely grazed by a
heavily laden motor-van. “Julie, you’re a public menace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—than you, and he can’t do a thing except play golf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed again, this time at Julie’s imperturbable
calm. “Everything’s all right, old girl,” he said, “and you
needn’t try to apply balm to my bruised heart, though it’s
nice of you to want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they got out, having reached the Prouts’ handsome
brick residence, the plans for which Stacey had drawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the maid who opened the door for them followed
them into the living-room. “Mis’ Prout,” she announced
tragically, “Annie’s going to leave!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she?” said Julie, drawing off her gloves. “Well, that’s
a nuisance. Excuse me a minute, Stacey dear, while I telephone.
Go mix yourself a high-ball. You’ll find everything
on the sideboard in the dining-room.” And she sat
down at a small mahogany desk and opened a tiny cupboard
that concealed a telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey obeyed and presently returned with his glass to
the living-room, where he listened to his sister call up two
employment agencies to make application for a cook, and
telephone an advertisement to two newspapers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really are a wonder, Jule!” he said, when she had
closed the desk. “Calm and efficient as they make ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she returned, opening her eyes wide in surprise,
“that’s nothing! It happens so often that I should be a silly
if I were upset by it now. Perhaps you noticed that I didn’t
even have to look the telephone numbers up in the book.
Now we can talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just at this moment the maid returned to announce
the visit of a Miss Loeffler, who followed close upon the
maid’s heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Irene,” said Julie pleasantly. “Glad you dropped
in. You don’t know my brother, Stacey, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Loeffler gave Stacey a nod and a brief firm shake of
the hand, then threw herself down on the davenport, crossed
her legs, and swung the right one vigorously. She looked
about twenty-four years old, had dark bobbed hair, a small
pretty face with restless dark eyes and a petulant mouth,
and wore a brown street suit with a very short skirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I don’t approve of you, Captain Carroll,” she
said crisply, “because you <span class='it'>are</span> Captain Carroll, a tool of
militarism in the late capitalistic war. No, I’m glad to
meet you, but I don’t approve of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you wouldn’t, of course, Irene,” Julie observed
placidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well,” said Stacey, “even pity from you’s more dear
than that from another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally, if you quoted any one at me, it would have
to be some one hopelessly old-fashioned, like Shelley. Can
I have a high-ball, Julie?” she asked, jumping up. All her
movements were abrupt, like her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Julie. “Oh, no, Stacey, don’t try to get
it for her. Irene will be cross if you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, he followed Miss Loeffler into the dining-room
and at least stood by while she mixed her high-ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, in the midst of the operation, she turned to him
and gazed into his eyes. “What are you really like, Mr.
Carroll?” she demanded intensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully orderly,” he replied, reaching out to restrain
her hand that held the silver water-bottle. “Can’t bear to
see things spilled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh!” she said disdainfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went back to the living-room and sat down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See you’ve both been to the wedding,” remarked Miss
Loeffler. “You look it. Have a lingering odor of ceremony
about you. All very smooth and elegant, I suppose?” And
she lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julie was crocheting. “No, Irene,” she said, “you needn’t
go around pretending to despise weddings and then come
here and try to worm a description of this one out of me.
If you wanted to know what it was like you ought to have
gone to it and seen for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed, as much at his sister’s keenness as at her
guest’s eccentricity. But Miss Loeffler was vexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t pretend!” she asserted hotly. “I do dislike weddings.
And if I ever want to go and live with a man I
shall, without making a silly fuss about it, and then when
either he or I get bored we’ll simply break off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julie sighed. “I’m afraid you’ll find it a very nervous
wearing life,” she remarked calmly. “I shouldn’t care for
it myself, but then I’m—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, perfectly hopeless, Julie! You belong back in the
eighteen-eighties. What do you think about it, Mr.
Carroll?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About marriage?” Stacey asked. “Nothing at all.
Doesn’t interest me. But I should say you people were at
least as Victorian as Julie. You’re quite as excited about the
necessity of not having a ceremony as old-fashioned people
are about having one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Loeffler insisted angrily that this was not true, but
presently grew calmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway, you’re right about one thing,” she said, finishing
her high-ball, then setting the glass down on the floor
and dropping her cigarette end into it. “The whole question’s
overstressed. We’ve got other bigger things to think
about. Well, I must go. Just dropped in for a minute. See
you again soon, Julie. You going, Mr. Carroll? Give you a
lift if you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Stacey, getting up. He found the girl
physically attractive, and he was glad of anything that would
keep his thoughts from Marian. He followed her to her
handsome run-about, and they set off swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she said, “I don’t expect to have a car much
longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. When we have Soviets in America I suppose such
cars as remain will all be in the service of the public. Of
course they may put me to driving one, but more likely I’ll
have to cobble shoes or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a very good thing, too,” said Stacey. “Pleasant
occupation, nice leathery smell, and lots of time to reflect
on universal subjects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She frowned. “You don’t believe in me at all, do you?”
she demanded, looking at him petulantly. “You think
we’re all—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in her excitement she had pressed her foot on the
accelerator instead of the brake, so that they dashed past a
policeman who had raised his hand to stop them, swerved
madly around the front of a trolley-car that was approaching
on the cross street, sent pedestrians flying to left and
right, and returned to a normal speed only a hundred yards
farther along the avenue, fortunately not crowded, that they
were following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey sighed. “There’s not a pin to choose between you
and Julie,” he remarked patiently. “You both try to kill
me the same afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Loeffler laughed girlishly. “That <span class='it'>was</span> stupid of me,”
she admitted. “And you were quite the calmest thing I’ve
ever seen. But truly,” she went on earnestly, keeping the
car, however, at a discreet twelve miles an hour, “it’s serious.
You’d be surprised to know how much is stirring
deep, deep down right here in Vernon, that you’d think was
a positive stronghold of capitalism. Come with me now,
will you?” she said eagerly, “and let me show you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show me what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People who are really thinking, people who get together
and see things straight—the social revolution, Bolshevism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me!” said Stacey. “I knew Vernon was no longer
provincial, but I had no idea it was so metropolitan as
all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can laugh!” she returned darkly, “but you’ll see.
Of course you understand we trust your discretion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned off from the avenue and stopped the car before
an office building. “We meet here,” she announced,
“in an ordinary office-room, because it’s so conspicuous that
it’s perfectly safe.” And they went up in the elevator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The large room which they presently entered had been
given the semblance of a club. There were numerous easy
chairs around the floor, chintz curtains at the windows, and
across one end of the room a huge oak table with a vase of
flowers and many books and periodicals. Fifteen or twenty
people were in the room, some standing, some sprawling in
the chairs, two or three perched on the edge of the table.
The air was heavy with cigarette smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Comrade Loeffler!” several voices shouted, as Irene and
Stacey entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with a new comrade in tow!” cried some one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he isn’t exactly a comrade,” said Irene. “I just
brought him along because he’s so aggravating and skeptical.
But he’s perfectly safe. Stacey Carroll, comrades.”
And with a proprietary air she drew him over to one end of
the room. He rather liked Miss Loeffler. There was something
so girlish beneath her pose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey looked about him idly. All but five of the persons
in the room were women. He knew a few of them by sight,
and the faces of others were vaguely familiar to him; but
he had been away from Vernon for so long and so utterly
cut off from it mentally that it was hard for him to remember
old acquaintances. Doubtless he had met nearly all
these people formerly—he didn’t know. Anyway, they were
of a younger generation than he—in the twenties, most of
them. He observed that the majority of the women wore
their hair bobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why so much bobbing of hair, Miss Loeffler? Is it a
symbol of freedom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you might call it that,” she replied, sitting on
the arm of his leather chair. “If you were unlucky enough
to be a woman you’d appreciate the advantages of wearing
your hair short.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rather becoming to you,” he observed. “Can’t say
I think it is to all of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s stupid and old-fashioned to pay compliments,” she
returned coldly. “They don’t interest me at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” said Stacey, “but it’s difficult not to, with all this
air of freedom about, and you sitting so close to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She jumped up angrily, but then after a moment defiantly
resumed her seat on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the young men, Comrade Leslie Vane, approached
them. He wore a flowing black tie beneath a very low soft
collar. Stacey knew him. He was a poet—published things
occasionally in the “Pagan” and the “Touchstone”—and the
son of John Vane, the big flour man. People in Vernon
were very nice about it, but naturally at heart they felt
sorry for Mr. Vane, Senior, who was extremely well liked,
and rejoiced that at any rate his other son, John, Junior,
was normal. Stacey was rather inclined to share Vernon’s
point of view in this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Stacey,” said Vane languidly. “Glad to see a
militarist with an open mind, anyhow. First example I’ve
met with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey reflected, as he acknowledged the greeting, that
when the Middle-West turned esthetic it became mournfully
old-fashioned. Positively Leslie Vane was going back all
of twenty-five years in search of a style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” he said. “I’m open to conviction, but what do
you want to convince me of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” drawled Vane, “the papers have all been read;
you’re late. There’s only just general talk going on now,
but it may do you some good if you’ll listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little group had gathered around them, and the smoky
air became full of words, among which “Soviets,” “proletariat,”
and “Bolshevism” predominated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, too bored to listen, fell to wondering for a moment
about real Bolshevism. He shook his head. No use,
that either. He didn’t care if change did come. In a way
he would be furiously delighted if order was upset,—things
were so silly. But he didn’t believe in any millennium or
even in improvement through change. What had the war
accomplished?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—and so that, most of all,” some woman was saying, “is
the true lesson of Holy Russia. What do you think of it,
Mr. Carroll? I <span class='it'>won’t</span> call you Captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started. “Of Bolshevism? The—er—coming social
revolution. Oh, you’ll all be raped, then cut in little pieces,
and Comrade Leslie will have his throat cut. Not because
Bolshevism is so especially worse than anything else, but because
that’s what always happens when any kind of violence
gets loose. And, do you know? I don’t care a damn
whether it comes or not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He meant what he said, as much as he meant anything at
all in respect to these futile idiots, but, since there was no
passion in his words and his face remained expressionless,
his remarks were delightedly deemed a skilful evasion of the
question (“My dear, how <span class='it'>could</span> he say what he really
thought—he a captain and a Carroll?”) and an amusing
pleasantry. His bold use of the word “rape,” too, was
much appreciated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But such comments were made after his departure. For
neither Miss Loeffler’s physical attractiveness nor conversation
with the fashionable followers of Lenin could any
longer distract his mind from Marian. She and Ames
would be sitting close together now in the drawing-room of
a Pullman car.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He escaped from the club and went home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, he felt an amused curiosity to know what his
sister’s attitude had been toward her impetuous visitor, so
he called Julie up on the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think about that wild creature that broke
in on us to-day?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Irene?” said Julie’s calm voice. “Oh, she’s just a goose,
but she’s really quite nice and sweet and young at heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what I thought,” he assented. “Occurred
to me, though, that I’d better call you up and let you know
that she hadn’t eloped with me or done me any real harm—though
she nearly ran us into a street-car. Quite a
good time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Stacey, listen!” said Julie anxiously. “You won’t
go and fall in love with Irene, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “I won’t do anything without asking you
about it first, Jule. I lean on you, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the odd thing about it was that in a way he did.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One morning some three weeks later Stacey received a night
letter from Omaha. It was addressed “Honorable Stacey
Carroll” and read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My husband Jim is awfully sick with flu and I am afraid
he is going to die. He keeps asking for you though he is
out of his head and does not know what he says. Please,
Captain Carroll, come if you can because then he might get
well. Gertrude Burnham.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey wasted no time. He sent a telegram to say that
he was starting immediately, telephoned for a lower berth
on the evening train, and pulled a suitcase from a closet.
But in the midst of his neat methodical packing he suddenly
paused and gazed abstractedly away. It had occurred to
him that perhaps if Burnham could see him as he had been
in France the sick man might be more likely to recognize
him and might even—who could tell?—draw a little strength
from the old revived relationship of command and protectiveness.
Stacey took out the things he had already packed,
chose a larger bag, and put in his uniform at the bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He arrived in Omaha early the next morning, drove to a
hotel, unpacked his bag, put on his uniform, and took a taxi
to Burnham’s address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taxi stopped in front of a small dilapidated wooden
house in a shabby quarter surprisingly near the centre of
town. Stacey descended and paid the chauffeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before he had time to reach the door of the house it
opened and a woman hurried out to meet him. She was
thin, haggard, dishevelled, though not slovenly, with a worn
face and worn eyes about which strayed limp locks of black
hair, but there were faded traces of fineness in her. Stacey
remembered that Burnham had always spoken of his wife
with pride. She had, he often said, had a high-school
education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Captain Carroll,” she cried, “it’s awful good of you
to come, sir! I knew I oughtn’t to’ve asked you, but I didn’t
know <span class='it'>what</span> to do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you ought,” Stacey returned briefly, shaking
her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you wore your uniform, too,” she added, with a
pale half-smile. “That was just right. I wouldn’t have
thought you’d have thought of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered the house, in which the Burnhams occupied
one-half of the second floor. Three small children, shabby
and not very clean, with frightened faces, were waiting for
them just inside, and stared at Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I keep them looking better than this, Captain Carroll,
when everything’s all right,” Mrs. Burnham explained
apologetically, and they all climbed the stairs in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they went, Stacey reflected swiftly on a number of
things,—that what life did to Burnham was very like what
it did to Phil, and that a lot of criminal rubbish was being
talked about the prosperous workingman. Why, thought
Stacey, even his father, who was a kindly man, declared
bitterly that workmen were buying silk shirts to-day and
denounced them as profiteers! Well, suppose a man did
earn six dollars a day for manual labor, suppose he even
earned it regularly for six days in every week (which he
didn’t), how much was that a year? Let’s see. Eighteen
hundred and some dollars, on which, with the price of everything
gone wild, he was supposed to raise a family and live in
luxury. What rot! Stacey himself, who lived at home, had
a car that his father had given him, and cared little for
luxuries, felt pinched with two hundred dollars a month.
Oh, damn money!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached the top of the stairs and paused before a
door through which came a strange murmuring voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim won’t know you, sir,—not now,” said Mrs. Burnham,
“but if you’d be willing just to sit there a while,
maybe—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Stacey. “You have a good doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. At least, I guess he’s good. They don’t any
of them seem much help. He’ll be here at ten o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went in, Stacey and Mrs. Burnham; the children
were left outside the door. Burnham, flushed with fever,
lay tossing and muttering on a narrow bed. Stacey looked
down at him and lifted his hot hand, but there was no recognition
in the man’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll sit here,” said Stacey after a moment, drawing up a
chair beside the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman silently took another chair, and they remained
so for an hour and a half, neither of them speaking, she
rising at regular intervals to press a spoonful of medicine
between her husband’s teeth, until the doctor arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was brusque, had keen eyes, and appeared competent.
Stacey drew him aside at the conclusion of the visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any chance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the doctor, “fifty-fifty. He’s as likely to recover
as not. Splendid physique! There’s nothing much I
can do except to give stimulants in case of sudden collapse.
We don’t know anything about flu really, you know, and this
pneumonia that follows on flu. I’ve seen hundreds die of
it—I was in France, too,—and hundreds get well,—both
without any reason. Served under you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My first sergeant. Good man,—no better! Do your best
for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a strong bond, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded. “Oughtn’t he to have a nurse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a great deal better. He’d have more of a
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then send one around, will you please? At my expense,
of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said the doctor, shook hands with Stacey,
and departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation had taken place in the hallway outside
the door. When Stacey reëntered the sick room Mrs. Burnham
gazed at him wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” he said. “Jim’s got a good chance. The
doctor’s going to send a nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth as
though to speak, but closed it again, with only a strangled:
“Thanks,” and turned her head away. After a time she
got up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go down and cook some dinner,” she said. “You’ll
excuse me, sir, if it isn’t much, won’t you? I haven’t had
time to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he broke in, “you’re too tired to cook. Please
go out and get some lunch for yourself and the children if
you know of some delicatessen place,—and for me, too.”
And he drew out his purse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this her face colored. “No sir,” she said, with just
a hint of resentment, “I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thrust a five-dollar bill upon her. “Do as I tell you,”
he said imperiously. “This is no time for silly pride. Go
on, and mind you get good things and plenty of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cowered beneath his sternness and went meekly.
And Stacey reflected grimly that pride was a decorative
handsome emotion that flourished ornamentally, a highly
esteemed orchid, in luxury. It couldn’t grow well in
poverty, came up sickly and scrawny,—the soil was too weak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later he heard her climb the stairs again and
move quietly about the next room. Presently she returned
to the bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you go in there now, sir?” she said. “Everything’s
ready for you. Here’s your change—two dollars and sixty-four
cents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, please!” he replied. “Keep it for to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wanted to insist on her eating first, but thought best
not to try, so he went, without comment, through the door
she indicated into another bedroom—the only other, he supposed,—that
obviously also served as dining-room and parlor.
Dishes were disposed neatly on a table, with sandwiches,
Bologna sausage, eggs, coffee, and doughnuts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down, then looked up, listening, with a smile, and
suddenly rose, crossed the room, and flung open another
door. The kitchenette. And there, as he had thought, were
the three children, sitting, very terrified at his discovery of
them, close together on a small bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello,” he said, “you’re out here, are you? Well, come
on! Let’s eat together. Only I think we’d better do it in
this room or your mother will hear us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said we was to wait and not make a noise,” observed
the oldest girl in a small voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we won’t wait,” Stacey remarked. “There are
doughnuts, you know. You come on in with me,” he said
to the girl who had spoken, “on your tip-toes, and help fix
the plates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First we’ll fix one for your mother,” he whispered, and
she nodded, her lips pressed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and the three children ate gravely in the kitchenette.
Then Stacey rose. “I’ll go back to your father now,” he
said, “and send your mother out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your plate is ready for you, Mrs. Burnham. And the
children have eaten,” he announced in a triumphant whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gasped, then suddenly her mouth curved prettily into
a smile—the first he had seen her give. Stacey sat down
again by the bedside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burnham seemed a little calmer now, and his incoherent
muttering had ceased, but he looked very exhausted, and
Stacey was relieved when about one o’clock the nurse
arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three of them sat there silently all the hot afternoon,
with only short intervals of release when Stacey stretched
his legs in the hall or Mrs. Burnham went out to keep an
eye on the children. There was no change in the sick man.
The nurse said that the crisis would probably be reached
next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At six o’clock Stacey left the house, asking the nurse to
telephone him in case of a serious change. He walked back
to his hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was abstracted, an isolated personality, growing more
isolated with every month that passed in his life; so that
now he saw little of his surroundings and glanced but carelessly
both at the depressing quarter from which he had set
out and at the prosperous business section he presently entered.
He merely thought, idly, that the city seemed a characterless
place, like all other middle-western cities. And the
imposing court-house, of white marble, that he passed
shortly before reaching his hotel, did not impress him. It
did, indeed, occur to him once that there was a certain tensity
in the air, like that which characterizes a city in boom
times, but the observation, purely involuntary, did not particularly
interest him. It interested him not at all when
later, glancing through the front page of a local paper, he
learned the cause of the tensity—trouble with the negroes,
“Another Dastardly Assault!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early the next morning he was back at Burnham’s house.
The man seemed worse, Stacey thought with a touch of
real sadness,—more feverish, more restless. There was no
capacity for smiling, even faintly, left in Mrs. Burnham.
The nurse, cool, professional, would express no opinion;
and the doctor, too, when he came, was noncommittal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before to-night there ought to be a decision one way or
the other,” he said to Stacey. “I’ll come again at four. Call
me up earlier if necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to do but wait, and Stacey again settled
himself in a chair near the foot of the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crisis came early in the afternoon. Burnham tossed
and kicked furiously, and his incoherent muttering grew
louder. Suddenly he raised himself on the palms of his
hands into a half-sitting posture and stared directly at
Stacey—or not really at him, through him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, Captain!” he cried wildly, in a high unnatural
voice, “you’ve got nerve! Might’ve been shot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shot
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shot! What hell you care? You wouldn’t do it!” He
panted. “Not you, Captain! Said I’d follow you to hell.
Nerve .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nerve .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nerve.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” His voice trailed away
to silence, while the nurse leaned over him, pressing his
shoulders down firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had started at the words. They were spoken, he
knew, in delirium, not to him but to a shadow vanished
eleven months since, but Stacey understood them. Burnham
knew, then, did he, about that Argonne attack? Good!
Probably no other kind of approbation from any source
would have touched Stacey, even faintly. This, for an instant,
made him thrill with a fierce proud happiness. The
next moment there was nothing left in his consciousness but
concern for his friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Burnham lay quiet now, his color less vivid, his breath
coming and going easily, and the nurse looked at Stacey
and Mrs. Burnham with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he’ll get along all right now,” she said pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey wiped his forehead, and Mrs. Burnham, collapsing
into a chair, laid her head on a table and wept softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine!” said the doctor, when he came. “He’ll get well
now. Just a question of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, when Mrs. Burnham opened the door
to Stacey, he observed that she was wearing a clean dress
and had done her hair quite prettily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Jim’s a lot better, isn’t he?” he asked, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed. “Yes,” she said. “He slept right through
the night. Only woke up once for just a minute, then went
back to sleep again. Oh, I’m so glad, Captain Carroll!”
Her eyes filled. “And so grateful to you, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please!” said Stacey, embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late in the morning Burnham opened his eyes slowly and
let them wander curiously about the room. They rested on
Stacey, and a puzzled expression came into them, then, after
a moment, recognition, and the man tried to raise his hand
in salute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the devil, sir?” he asked, in a thin voice. Then
he smiled. “Funny!” he said. “I thought I was in hell.”
And he began to laugh weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up, Burnham!” Stacey commanded sternly, “and
lie still!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right, Captain, all right!” Burnham returned, still
laughing, and went to sleep again at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was rather tired in the evenings now from sitting
so monotonously still all day. He resented the excitement
that he felt throbbing in the streets and the nervous buzz
of the groups through which he had to elbow his way in
the hotel lobby. His one recreation consisted in changing
to civilian clothes for dinner; for he always wore his uniform
when he went to the Burnhams’. It happened that
the regiment in which he had commanded a battalion had
been recruited from this part of the country, so that there
were perhaps twenty-five of his men living right here in
Omaha, among them a first lieutenant whom he had sincerely
liked. And, ignorant though he was and knew himself
to be of these men’s real personalities, he was bound to
each of them—worst as well as best—by a closer bond than
that which held him to Philip Blair or to Marian or to Mrs.
Latimer. He would have given lavishly of his money or his
time—nonsense! of something real! his freedom or his
strength!—to any of these men who needed it; and not in
the least from a sense of duty,—inevitably, as a matter of
course. Yet he had no companionable desire to see them.
He made no attempt to look them up. He spent his evenings
in bed, reading “War and Peace,” which in former
days he had not cared for but now found singularly satisfying—more
satisfying than any book by his old idol,
Dostoieffsky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burnham’s recovery was extraordinary. On the third day
after the crisis the doctor refused jovially to waste more
time in visiting him—the nurse had been dismissed the day
before—and told him to eat, talk and do as he pleased, short
of getting up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” observed Stacey that afternoon, “that I’ll pull
out to-night on the midnight. You’re as fit as ever,
Burnham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was, indeed, restless and anxious to go. Here, sitting
near Burnham, chatting casually of trivial things, he was
strangely at peace; but an increasing turmoil that he felt in
the city each evening exasperated him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked at him wistfully, then across at his wife.
“Gerty,” he said, “you go out with the kids for a little
while, will you? I got to talk to the Captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed, but her face had flushed and her eyes were
resentful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’ve done it!” said Stacey cheerfully. “Fat lot
of popularity I’ll have with Gertrude from now on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burnham laughed. “Funny thing, ain’t it, Captain?” he
observed. “They can’t seem to get onto it at all, women
can’t. They go and get jealous, like Gerty now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t get onto what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, this—this here what-do-you-call-it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Relationship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh, I guess that’s the word. It ain’t got a thing to
do with them.” He paused. “Maybe that’s why they don’t
like it,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Philosopher!” said Stacey. “Analyzing the female
heart. You’ll be writing for the magazines next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” Burnham grinned, then frowned. “All the
same, I don’t get onto it very well myself,” he continued.
“Now you’d think that I ought to be feeling all upset with
gratitude to you, the way Gerty is, and worried about you
wasting so much of your time and money. Well, I don’t
feel that way at all. Damned if I do! I just feel friendly
and pleasant and—natural-like. And of course some day
I’m going to pay you back the money you spent on the nurse
’n’ doctor, but it don’t seem important, somehow, like it
does to Gerty. If it was something you cared about, Captain,
I’d get up now, the way I am, and work all day to get
it for you, but Christ! you don’t care a damn for money!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, shut up, Burnham!” said Stacey, laughing. “How
you do run on!” Nevertheless, the man’s words were pleasant
to him, and reënforced his own strangely peaceful mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems sort of noisy out-doors to-day,” Burnham remarked
suddenly. “What’s the row, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, indeed, through the window a dull and sullen murmur,
that was like a deep note held steadily in an organ, did
enter and penetrate the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” replied Stacey quickly, “I don’t know! It’s a noisy
city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burnham lay silent for a long time. Then he turned his
eyes slowly to Stacey. And in them and in his voice when
he spoke again was apparent a timidity which his huge bulk
and rough unshaven face made somehow touching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain,” he said hesitantly, “there was something I
wanted to say to you, only I don’t know if I’ve got the nerve.
We boys was always kind of scared of you, you know,—oh,
not because you was a captain!—fat lot of respect we had
for captains <span class='it'>as</span> captains!—but just because—oh, I dunno!
And it’s kind of hard to say anything to you that’s kind of
personal, as you might say. All the same, I’ll take a chance.”
He rushed on with his words to get it over. “What I want
to say is that some of us know all about that attack that—didn’t
come off.” He paused apprehensively, but with a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Stacey was as friendly as before. “Yes,” he
said quietly, “I know you do. You let that out Wednesday
in a lot of wild talk you were spouting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you know about that?” Burnham exclaimed.
“And me who wouldn’t have told even Gerty!
Did any one—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, it’s all right! No one else understood. And
I’m glad you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’N’ that’s why I said what I did about going with you
to hell or anywhere else. I ain’t the only one, Captain.
There’s Morgan and Jones and Petitvalle and Isaacs and all
the rest of C Company that knows, who’d fight to go along,
too. Oh, it would be a nice little family party!” And Burnham
laughed gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, Stacey had said to Phil months ago that this was the
one exploit of which he was proud, but he had said so
haughtily, with his heart full of bitterness. Just now his
heart was calm, as though cleansed. He was almost happy.
Yet he could hardly have accounted for his state of mind,
even had he cared to try. It was not, certainly, that his
vanity was flattered. Perhaps it was, in part, that when
Stacey had related the episode to Philip Blair his defiance
of the machine was first in his thoughts, while now the
stress was on the human results of that defiance. Perhaps
Burnham’s simple assertion of loyalty released Stacey from
his obsessing perception of greed, greed everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the noise outside had increased. Rolling waves of
sound entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in hell is going on?” Burnham exclaimed. “Tell
me, Captain! You know all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Stacey doubtfully, but thinking it on the
whole better not to have the invalid aggravated by unsatisfied
curiosity, “there’s been a lot of race trouble here lately.
Just now it seems to be mostly about some negro—name of
Brown—said to have assaulted a woman. He’s shut up in
the court-house jail, I believe. Sounds as though some sort
of demonstration—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this moment a scattered crackling sound broke out
in the distance. Burnham sat up quickly, and Stacey crossed
to the window and looked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some sort of demonstration?” said Burnham. “Some
sort of riot! That’s shooting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded, pulled down the window sash, and came
back to his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Burnham entered the room hurriedly, but, though
frightened, she had not forgotten her grievance. “I suppose
I can come in now,” she said, “since there’s a war or something
going on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” returned her husband, laughing. “It’s nothing,
Gerty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darkness fell while they sat there together, Mrs. Burnham
soon ashamed of her pettishness and trying to think
up little things she could do for Stacey, Burnham stretching
his arms and legs to feel their returning strength, all three
chatting about the most casual matters. A lamp sputtered
alight in the street and shone in upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oddly, Stacey thought of that afternoon with Phil and
Catherine in New York five years ago. He had the same
sense of calm now as then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this sea of sound that roared dully in the distance,
at times swelling for a moment so that Mrs. Burnham
turned her eyes apprehensively to Stacey,—it had been
absent then. Had it, though? What else was the war?
Stacey thought fancifully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve really got to go now,” he remarked, and rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Burnham tried stammeringly to express her gratitude,
but Burnham only gripped Stacey’s hand and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I say good-bye to the children?” asked Stacey, and
Mrs. Burnham, too, smiled at this and went in search
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now look here, Captain!” said her husband anxiously in
a low voice as soon as she had left the room, “you won’t get
mixed up in that mess in the streets, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey shook his head. “No, no, I’ll be all right,” he replied
reassuringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The noise outside continued.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey glanced up and down the street, but it lay quiet and
empty in the brightness of its regularly spaced arc-lights.
The noise came from the direction of the centre of town,
and as this was also the direction of his hotel he sighed and
set off toward it. He sighed because he felt himself stepping
back into the old shadow from the rare brightness of
his recent mood. It occurred to him that life was like that,
some one had said,—a handful of peaceful islands scattered
stingily over a tumultuous sea. Which figure reveals how
little he knew himself—what he was and what he wanted.
For at heart he did not crave repose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned a corner, the rumble of sound became a roar,
and he was on the edge of the crowd. Some distance down
the street into which he had emerged, on the left at its intersection
by another wider thoroughfare, he could make out a
corner of the white marble court-house that had left him
unimpressed. And one side of this building—the east, it
must be—stretched along flush with the street that Stacey
followed. But all about and obscuring such part of the
structure as lay within his vision there was now a black
howling throng, while, over all, smoke hung. And even
here, where Stacey stood, the crowd was dense. Traffic
had ceased. Motor cars stood motionless. Men had scrambled
up the sides of them and clung there, all staring in one
direction; and from the windows of the houses flanking the
street more people leaned and gazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the crowd was not yet a mass—groups only; but as
Stacey went forward toward the court-house, which was
perhaps an eighth of a mile away, it thickened, so that to
traverse it became increasingly difficult. And as it thickened
its temper grew manifestly warmer. A confusion of cries
agitated it. Sometimes they burst into a refrain—“Nigger!
Nigger! We want that nigger!” Arms were thrown up,
gesticulating wildly. And there were little centres of local
interest—a man suddenly hauling himself up to the shoulders
of another for a view and thrown down again fiercely,
snarling contests over invaded personal rights, animal-like
squeals of women at the crushing pressure upon them. The
sweating faces had a bestial look beneath the arc-lights, and
a sourish human odor tainted the warm air. Noise! Noise!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was not feeling anger—only a deep disgust, disgust
of crowds, sick disgust of all humanity. His emotion
was the more acute for its contrast with the mood he had felt
in Burnham’s house. He was like a man who has made a
longer jump by taking a running start. So this was the kind
of thing on which perpetual peace and leagues of nations
were to be founded, was it? he thought coldly. He
would have gone back out of its contamination, having
certainly no desire to witness the spectacle it clamored
for, save that he had some desperate idea of perhaps
being able to assist the few who must somewhere be
standing off the multitude. So he fought his way forward,
inch by inch, helped perhaps a very little by the fact
that he was in uniform, using his shoulders and elbows
mercilessly in cold contempt of his victims, shrieked at,
cursed at, struck at even, but making progress, until at
last he came, panting, to the corner of his own street and
that other wider avenue. He could get no farther, either
ahead or to the left. The crowd was a solid wall. And to
return was equally impossible. He could only stay where he
was and hope that something might happen, some movement
in the mob, that would make it possible for him to push
through suddenly and reach the court-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood on tip-toe and looked about him. He was almost
at the corner, close to the right hand edge of the street,
and he perceived that here the latter was flanked by the
side wall of what he took to be a theatre. In the wall, some
two or three feet above the ground, were embrasures, vantage
points held with difficulty by tightly wedged groups.
As Stacey looked, a sudden backward surge of the crowd
swept down and away two such members of one group, and
Stacey, diving desperately in, himself struggled up to the
place and held it against all contestants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All events were submerged beneath a roar of voices, a
sea of noise that broke in echoing waves against the sides
of the buildings. It was an emotion in itself, irrespective of
its cause. It hypnotized the crowd, produced a singular wild
stare in men’s eyes, made their movements jerky, their own
involuntary addition to the noise raucous. It did not hypnotize
Stacey, because he was aloof, remote, and also because
he was too familiar with noise. Yet, he, too, had undergone
its terrible spell—early in the war, before he had grown
hard enough to bear the unbearable. He knew bitterly well
what Siegfried Sassoon meant by: “I’m going stark, staring
mad because of the guns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey threw one last contemptuous glance at the mob
beneath him, then gazed off over their heads at the court-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing he noted was that it was on fire, smoke
creeping dully from its ground-floor windows; the second,
that fighting was going on inside it, since the south door,
that opening on the wide cross-street, was shattered, while
through it rushed in or were driven back mad struggling
clusters of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for the police!” thought Stacey. “Oh, by God!
I wish I were there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two firemen appeared at a third-floor window, and from
the nozzle of the hose they held a stream shot down upon
the crowd. There was a wild surging movement that swept
to the crowd even here, pushing it back upon itself tumultuously.
Snarls of anger rose. There were struggles, shrieks,
fists striking out, mad efforts of individuals to keep from
being crushed. And up ahead on the left the lighted air was
shadowed by the bricks and stones hurled through it against
the court-house. The court-house windows shattered in
fragments. Stacey could not hear them crash—the noise of
voices submerged all other sounds, as it was submerging
thought—but he could see the jagged black gaps appear and
the shining rain of glass. He held his place in the embrasure
with difficulty, clinging to an iron ring in the wall and to
his nearest companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly a vast exultant roar shook the crowd.
The stream of water had ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut it! We’ve cut their damned hose! Cut! Cut it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd was wilder now, frenzied. Stacey, looking
down, saw faces convulsed, venomous, filthy with ugliness.
He felt a shudder of loathing and recollected with passionate
assent what Anatole France had called life—“a sickness,
a leprosy, a mold on the face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nigger! Give us that nigger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed. Stacey, knowing mobs, thought that perhaps
eventually this one would wear itself out on its own
emotion, begin to break up into individuals sick with fatigue,
and little by little disperse. But he soon perceived that it
had too varied a spectacle to witness, an immense vicious
vaudeville, something new every few minutes,—a ladder
thrown against the court-house wall, half scaled by eight
or ten youths, pushed slowly back by the defenders, and
crashing over at last to earth, the scalers leaping off wildly
as it fell; a rush through the door; fighting; shots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even so, the mob had sullen moments when its roar sank
to a rumble, but again it occurred to Stacey that it was being
lashed up afresh by leaders. There was a young man on a
white horse there in the street before the besieged building.
Twice he wheeled his horse about and harangued the crowd.
His voice was inaudible here, but the emotion he created
immediately around him swept on, like something tangible,
beyond the reach of his words, and his gestures stirred men
to renewed frenzy. Also it struck Stacey that, while here
at the corner the crowd was jammed beyond hope of penetration,
there on the left, just before the south side of the
court-house, where the fight was sharpest, was room to
move. There were rushes, assaults. The fighting part of
the mob was relatively small. Oh, they all wanted the
negro, damn them! They wanted blood and torture. But
as spectators. If only he could get there!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at this thought, that there were deliberate leaders,
anger began to rise in Stacey, who till now had felt only
disgust and scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a sudden whirling streamer of red light curved into a
broken window of the court-house and a dull explosion
made the air throb. A red glare flamed up inside the building,
and a great “Ah-h-h!” came from the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God! look at it!”—“A bomb! Oh, <span class='it'>Christ</span>! a bomb!”—“Oh,
<span class='it'>look</span> at her burn!”—“Nigger, we’ll get him now!”—“Oh,
<span class='it'>nigger</span>!”—“A-e-e-e!” Shouts, leaps, struggles,
madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd could afford to wait now, thought Stacey,
looking on grimly, as black smoke poured from windows
and rose in clouds, begriming the marble walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late. How long had he been here in this filth?
Two hours? Three? Stacey looked at his watch. Ten-thirty.
He gazed back wearily down the street, in a sullen
despair beneath which anger smoldered. An outrage to
be born into such a world! And he could not take refuge in
himself. He hated himself as he hated this mob. Oh, he
did not, of course, feel with them now! What was a black
man’s life or a white man’s—any man’s—his own—Philip
Blair’s, even—to deserve such clamor? He was hard,
crusted over with bitterness. But there had been times in
France when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden frenzied shriek from the mob made him start
and turn his eyes back to the court-house. On the steps
at its entrance, that opening on the street which Stacey had
followed, alone in the lurid smoky light stood a man—rather
stout, not tall, but impressive in his solitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mayor!”—“It’s the mayor!”—“Smith!”—“Mayor!”
came in a shattered volley of cries from all about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in one fierce burst of sound: “Nigger! Give us that
nigger! Nigger! Nigger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, after this, dwindling sound, save from the storm
centre at the south entrance where the news could not be
known; finally a semblance of silence. Stacey could not
hear the man’s voice when he spoke—“I can’t do that,
boys!” he learned later the words had been—but he could
see him shake his head and could see the firm negative gesture
he made with both extended hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An immense insane howl of anger burst out. A crowd
surged up the east steps, and the solitary figure disappeared
among them, dragged down in a chaotic black mass of
assailants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thrill of exultation and anger ran through Stacey. By
God! he’d stood them off! One living man with a soul of
his own against the mob! And he was to be dragged down
like that? killed for it? Beside himself, Stacey leaped to
the ground and fought madly to break through to the one
man on the scene. Impossible! Far from pushing forward,
he was caught in a sudden retreating surge of the throng
and swept back, back, raging, down the street, to the edge
of a narrow roofed-in alley that led out of it behind the
theatre building. Here he held his own once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mad cries of wrath against the mayor came from all
about him. “Nigger lover!”—“<span class='it'>Get</span> the nigger lover!”—“Lynch
him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close to Stacey a heavy red-faced man was shaking his
clenched fists high in the air. “Oh, <span class='it'>lynch</span> him! The God-damn
<span class='it'>son</span> of a bitch! Oh, nigger lover! Oh, <span class='it'>kill</span> him!
<span class='it'>Lynch</span> him!” he shrieked, his voice hoarse, his face purple,
convulsed, incredibly bestial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly a white ungovernable rage flared up in
Stacey. There was nothing left of his personality but rage.
He seized the man about the waist, and, helped by a new
surge of the crowd, half flung him, half was swept with
him, back into the narrow dark entrance of the alley and
down it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The momentum gathered from the crowd hurled both forward,
staggering, and separated them. But Stacey was upon
his man again instantly. They were perhaps thirty yards
down the alley in a semi-obscurity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! You! What d’you—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey merely dived, in hot silence, for the man’s throat,
and fastened his hands upon it tensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The victim struck out wildly, gasped, kicked, but Stacey
bent him back and leaned over, sinking his thumbs deeper
and deeper with every ounce of his great strength into the
fleshy throat. And, as he pressed, he had the delirious
exultant delusion that he was strangling all humanity. His
teeth were set. His eyes were terrible with hatred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s face grew violet, his eyes protruded loathsomely,
his gurgling mouth opened to press out a swollen
tongue. Then all at once he relaxed weakly, his whole
body limp. Stacey flung him off, and he fell in a sprawled
motionless heap to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey looked down for a moment and pushed the body
with the toe of his shoe, then turned away, wiping his hands
on his handkerchief. He was quite calm again, fierce, but
with no further impulse to kill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not go back and fight his way into the crowd once
more. Where was the use? He could not break through.
Instead, he followed the alley in, leaving the roar of the
crowd behind him, and came out eventually into another
street, parallel with the one he had left. It, too, was
crowded, but not densely like the first. Stacey made his
way off from it swiftly, and before long reached still another
street, empty, silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from back over there behind the intervening house-walls
came yet wilder noise and crackling volleys of shots.
They had got the negro, Stacey supposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode on for a long, long time—half an hour? an
hour?—heedless of direction, turning corners aimlessly,
until at last he was walking up a street down which, toward
him, people were flowing in groups, talking loudly. The
show was over, no doubt, the audience dispersing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard excited comments. “The nigger got his, all
right!”—“Damn shame about the mayor!”—“Oh, I dunno!
Too damn fresh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey whirled about and caught the man who had said it
was a shame. “Did they kill the mayor?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man addressed stared, open-mouthed, with frightened
eyes at Stacey’s stern face. “N-no!” he stammered.
“They hung him up tw-twice, but he was—was cut down.
He’s all right, I guess. Th-they got him away. I said it
was a damned shame,” he added weakly, trying to release
himself from Stacey’s grasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey did not reply, but withdrew his hand and strode
on, his teeth set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he walked aimlessly for a long while, but at last,
making a wide curve, he turned back toward the noise that
still came in broken waves from the riot centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, led by the glow of the fire, he approached the
court-house once more, but now from the north. On this
side it was not flush with the street but set in some fifty
yards behind an ornamental grass-plot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Street, grass-plot and curving walks were covered with a
howling throng, not so thick as to prevent passage, but rushing
wildly this way and that under the red light from the
burning building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The centre of the confusion Stacey presently made out to
be a motor car careering about through the crowd, that
shouted exultantly and stumbled back out of its path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All at once it bore down on Stacey. He sprang aside to
avoid it, then, looking back, saw that after it, at the end of
a rope, trailed a shapeless bumping object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rope that towed this curious object caught for a moment
on an electric light pole, the car came to a temporary
halt, and Stacey, bending over to look at the thing more
closely, perceived that it was the charred, naked and limbless
torso of a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three hysterical girls, their hats awry, their arms linked,
pushed him out of the way and kicked, squealing, at the
dead flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey left the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found a small lunch-room open in a neighboring
street. It was crowded with genial exulting ex-rioters. But
Stacey pressed up to the counter, ordered sandwiches and
coffee, and gulped them down ravenously. He was frankly
famished. This did not shock him. He was too familiar
with the physical effects of emotion even to give it a thought.
And, indeed, so far as emotion went, he had, despite his
almost impassive bearing, gone through more of it than the
mob itself. For the mob had hated the negro and the mayor;
Stacey had been consumed with hatred of the colossal mob
itself—and of all men, all human life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left the lunch-room and went to his hotel. As he
reached its doorway there was an echoing tramp of steady
feet, and he turned to see a company of infantry march past.
He saluted, and the officer marching beside the men saluted
in return, gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s time!” thought Stacey bitterly. “If I’d had two men
and a machine-gun I could have cleared the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had thought he was done with all sympathy for
armies. Error! He would have given his right hand to-night
to be in command of his battalion. Not because he
cared for law and order. He didn’t give <span class='it'>that</span> for law
and order! But because he could have saved the mayor—one
brave man, a living individual—from the collective
beast. And because he could have saved the negro.
But mostly because he could have killed! killed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered the hotel. Here, too, though the hour was
late, were excited groups. Stacey pushed through them and
up to the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The key to four hundred and twelve,” he demanded
peremptorily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the clerk, his elbows on the desk, was listening to the
voluble conversation of a group of commercial travellers
and paid no attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey seized a paper-weight, lifted it, and flung it down
with a crash. “Damn you! The key to four-twelve, I said!
And be quick about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk jumped. “Y-yes, sir,” he stammered, and
reached a trembling hand for the key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably at a normal moment he would have asserted his
right to respect as a free American citizen. To-night things
were rather strange.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, after Stacey had bathed, he stood for a
moment, reflecting, then again put on his uniform. In the
midst of dressing he paused to look in the telephone directory
for the name of the lieutenant whom he had especially
liked in his first company and who, he remembered, lived
in Omaha. He called up the number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curtis Traile’s house? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, this Traile? Good!
Stacey Carroll talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard a joyful exclamation. “It is! What are you
doing here? Where are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you—you saw all that mess last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Stacey drily. “Listen, Traile! Can I see
you this morning? If you’ll tell me how to get to where
you live I’ll—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>will</span> not! I’ll be around at the hotel for you inside
of twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Thanks. You’ll find me in the dining-room.
’Bye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey went down into the dining-room and ordered breakfast.
Then he unfolded a newspaper. Outwardly he appeared
as unmoved as ever. It was only when he came upon
the one piece of news he cared about—“<span class='it'>Mayor’s Condition
Serious! Still Unconscious at Three This Morning! Doctors
Hopeful!</span>”—that a ripple of emotion passed over his
face. He ate his breakfast calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on page four he happened upon a small item cursorily
recorded which he read with interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>At twelve-thirty this morning after the termination of</span>
<span class='it'>the riot Sergeant of Police Bassett, who was patrolling
Seventeenth Street, heard groans issuing from the covered
alley leading in behind the Boyd Theatre. On investigating
he discovered that they came from a man lying in the alley
in a semi-unconscious condition and apparently suffering
from attempted strangulation. When able to speak he at
first gave his name as John Smith and claimed to have been
assaulted, at what time he could not say, by a man wearing
U. S. Army uniform. Later he admitted he was Adolph
Kraft of 1102 Chicago Street and withdrew his first story,
declaring that he was attacked by an unknown man while
endeavoring to restrain the rioters from further violence.
He was taken to Ford Hospital, where his condition was
said to be serious but not critical. The police attach little
credence to either story told by Kraft, believing his injury
to be the result of some personal vengeance carried out
during the confusion of the riot. Kraft was formerly a
bar-tender and so far as known has no present occupation.
He has been twice convicted of petty offences.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I didn’t kill him, after all,” thought Stacey. “Doesn’t
appear that he’d have been much of a loss.” But he reflected
dispassionately, merely as noting a fact, that in his
assault he had shown the same overwhelming desire to kill
that had possessed the mob. That the cause was different
on his part did not matter a straw. His intense will to murder
had been the same as theirs. Too bad! Not detached
enough! Not detached enough! He should have slain the
man coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cordial voice interrupted his meditations. “Well, <span class='it'>Cap</span>tain!—I
say! You’re in uniform! You of all people! How
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Traile,” said Stacey, looking up and shaking
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lieutenant was young and had a fresh pleasant expression
when, as now, he was smiling. When, as a moment
later, his face grew sober again there was a certain gravity
in it, as though a curtain had been dropped,—a hint of the
same shadow that hung about Stacey. And this odd contrast
in the young man’s face between buoyant youthfulness
and weary knowledge impressed Stacey, since he had not
seen Traile for many months, and was therefore now seeing
him freshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is fine!” Traile continued swiftly. “But it was
pretty rotten of you to be here so long and never let me
know. Oh, I know all about it now, you see! Dropped
around at Burnham’s on the way here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine! He told me about your coming and staying with
him. Confound it! he might have let <span class='it'>me</span> know he was sick!
But no! his wife had to go and wire you!” Traile concluded
ruefully, pausing for breath. He sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have some breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, no. I’ve eaten. Then you—you saw all that
last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded. “Have you read the estimable comment
in the morning paper?” he asked. “Listen!—‘<span class='it'>Whatever the
provocation it does not warrant any band of men taking
the law into their own hands unless they are prepared to
face the judgment of their fellow citizens for such an act.</span>’
Seems sufficiently moderate, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile flushed. “Isn’t that damnable!” he blurted out
boyishly. “You must think I live in a rotten town!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Stacey somberly, “I wish I did think so. If
that were all there was to it we could band together cheerfully
to blow up Omaha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you what, Captain!” Traile cried, his face stern.
“We’re going after the leaders if we can get them—going
after them hard! There are scores of names listed already;
there’ll be twice as many by to-night. General Wood’s been
ordered here. Arriving to-morrow morning. And meanwhile
we’re organizing the Legion men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded. “I thought you would be. That’s what I
particularly wanted to see you about. I’m not from here,
of course, but I want you to let me in on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile’s face radiated a sudden joyful surprise. “You,
Captain?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked Stacey coolly, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” stammered the other, “I—of course we’ll take
you in with a rush. You’re in uniform, too. How
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey looked at him thoughtfully. “You needn’t be embarrassed,
Traile,” he said. “You’re quite right. I <span class='it'>don’t</span>
like army stuff and I <span class='it'>don’t</span> care a fig about helping maintain
law and order in this pleasant world. But <span class='it'>if</span>,” he said,
his eyes and voice hard, “I can do any fighting against a
thousand beasts that tortured one lone individual, and
especially that mauled and half killed the one man who stood
up to them”—his teeth snapped together—“why, then, I’d
like to; that’s all,” he concluded in his normal voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile stared at him for a moment in silence. “Come
home with me,” he said, and rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” remarked Stacey calmly. “Just give me time to
sign my check.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile’s car was outside. They entered it and drove
swiftly off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just to show you the way some of us feel about this,”
the lieutenant remarked presently, “I’ll tell you that I’ve
been ’phoning steadily ever since six-thirty this morning.
That’s why you got me so promptly when you called up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To our boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What results?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lieutenant frowned, gave the car a sudden exasperated
burst of speed, then slowed down somewhat. “Unsatisfactory.
Hang it, they won’t come! Only two of ’em,
Mills and Jackson, who’re at my house now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you really think they’d volunteer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Traile shortly, “I didn’t. The ones who’ll
jump at the job will be the sweet lads who drilled in safe
camps and never so much as saw a transport.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well,” Stacey replied coolly, “that wasn’t their fault,
and no more’s their point of view. You’re a funny cuss,
Traile! Here you are, wanting men to show up, yet I’m
blessed if you aren’t railing at the ones who do and praising
your men because they don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” admitted the other, laughing sheepishly.
“But then, aren’t we all that—funny cusses, I mean—we
chaps who saw the real show?” he added meditatively.
“Anyhow, will <span class='it'>you</span> try them, Captain? Maybe,” he concluded
diffidently, “they’ll come for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded. “I’ll try,” he assented. “How many enlisted
men of C Company, your company, live here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve,” said Traile promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how many of D Company—do you happen to
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten. Here we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned into a curved driveway leading up to a handsome
residence. Traile hurried Stacey out of the car and
down the hall of the house to the library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s who I made you wait for, boys!” he cried. “You
didn’t know—eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men in the room sprang to salute, surprise and
unmistakable pleasure in their faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey felt a sudden touch of gratitude, that was like the
warm trickle of a brook into an ice-bound lake. Yet he
said little enough to the men in the way of greeting—only a
word or two, and shook their hands. Then he plunged at
once into business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mills,” he said, “can you and Jackson corral all the men
of your company and of D Company too, and get them
around here to see me, without obligation to anything—say
at noon sharp—that all right, Lieutenant?” Traile nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” they replied in unison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Let’s make out a list, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what’s to do?” Traile remarked impatiently when
the men had departed. He was walking nervously about
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do?” said Stacey. “Nothing,—unless you can give me
a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet I can!” the other cried boyishly, and pushed a
bell in the wall. “Leagues and leagues of wine-cellar.
Family away in Maine. Whole house to myself. Great!
Come in, Blake. Scotch, please,—V.O.P.—and glasses and
ice and all that sort of thing.” He flung himself down in
a chair. “Funny! Ever since I got back I feel as though I
had to be doing something all the time, and yet there isn’t a
damned thing I really want to do. <span class='it'>You</span> feel that way at
all, Captain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Stacey, smoking moodily. “Now let’s see,” he
added in a different tone. “Where do we stand? What’s
the state of affairs in town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile sat up, alert again. “Two companies of troops
from Fort Crook patrolling the city—couldn’t get here last
night in time to do any good,” he added bitterly, “because
permission had to be granted from Washington first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I recognize the well-loved system.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh. General Wood arriving to-morrow morning.
No definite plan of action to be adopted till he gets here.
Listing of names of suspects going on rapidly, however.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded. “Do you think,” he asked meditatively,
“that we’ll have a chance to be in on the arresting part of
the game? That’s what I want. Patrolling streets is
no use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I do! The colonel from the fort said as much.
’T’s just what they will use us of the Legion for, because we
know the town. Here are our drinks. Now when we’ve
drunk them what in hell <span class='it'>shall</span> we do? I know!” he cried
triumphantly. “We’ll drive around to the hotel and bring
your things over here, where they ought to have been all
the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled. “All right,” he assented. “I don’t care
much for the night clerk at that hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At five minutes to twelve the library all at once overflowed
with men. There was pride in Stacey’s look as he
greeted them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many, Mills?” he demanded, after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty out of twenty-two, sir. Burnham’s sick—as you
know better’n any one else, Captain. Monahan, he—he
couldn’t come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t?” Stacey’s voice was regretful. “That’s
too bad.” He paused for a moment, reflecting. Then he
drew himself up very straight and gazed at the men, looking
keenly from one to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now look here, men,” he said. “You’re fed up on army
stuff and so am I. You know as well as I do that I haven’t
got a bit of authority over you. I can’t <span class='it'>tell</span> you to go and
do anything you don’t want to do. But last night some
things were done in this town that I happened to see. And
one of them was that a brave man stood out in front of a
mob of beasts and said ‘no’ to them. And what happened to
him because he said ‘no,’ as any one of you would have said,
was—oh, God damn it! you know what it was!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s face was white now, and his voice shook with
anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was your mayor,” he continued after a moment, “but
it isn’t that I care about. What I care about is that he was
a <span class='it'>man</span>. You fought the Germans and no one knows better
than I <span class='it'>how</span> you fought them. Well, there were <span class='it'>men</span> among
the Germans, decent men, whatever we think about what
they fought for. In this mob last night there weren’t any
men—just beasts. And I <span class='it'>ask</span> you—just <span class='it'>ask</span> you, mind!—if
you’ll turn in with Lieutenant Traile and me and go after
them. That’s all,” he concluded, and shut his teeth with
a snap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an instant’s pause. Then: “I guess you know,
Captain,” said one of the men awkwardly, “that we’ll all
of us do whatever you say—and do it <span class='it'>quick</span>!” he added
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Sergeant. Is that the way you all feel about
it? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thanks again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then,” he went on, in a brisker, matter-of-fact tone.
“Lieutenant Traile tells me that we’ll be able to make arrests.
Well, that’s what we want. I wouldn’t have called
you across the block for the sake of patrolling streets.
That’s a Boy Scout job. This is the way it’ll be, I suppose.
Officers will get lists given them and go out with a patrol of
men to get the animals listed. I don’t know how many men
they’ll assign to each officer, but two will be enough. Now
listen to me. I only want four of you to show up in uniform.
Let’s see—er—Morgan and Isaacs for me, Mills and
Jackson for Lieutenant Traile. The rest of you, all sixteen,
keep out of uniform. Don’t show up at any Legion meeting.
Report to me through Sergeant Peters and Corporals Petitvalle,
Blaine and Swanson. You’re to find out where the
men are whose names we’ll have given us. They won’t be
at their homes, of course, most of them. Then the six of
us in uniform will go get them. D’you see? Dirty work!
Spies’ work! Informing!” He paused questioningly, but
the laughter that greeted his warning was reassuring. “All
right, then,” he said easily. “You won’t be very popular, of
course, but who wants to be popular with skunks? That’s
all for now. Nothing doing till General Wood arrives.
The sergeant and the three corporals will come here at nine
to-morrow morning—in civilian clothes, mind!—and await
instructions. Morgan, Isaacs, Mills, and Jackson show up,
in uniform, at the Legion meeting to-morrow after General
Wood’s arrival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the men had gone Traile looked at Stacey oddly.
“Gee whiz, Captain!” he cried finally, “you’re stronger than
ever on love for military discipline, aren’t you? Here
you’ve gone and organized a civilian detective service right
in the bosom of the army! Oh, cripey!” And he burst out
laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Stacey coolly, “what we want is to get those
men, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Blake appeared at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” Traile exclaimed. “Lunch is ready. We’ll go
down. And this afternoon there’s a Legion meeting. I’ll
take you over. Not for the joy of it, but just because I’ll
have to present you to the officers—and to the colonel from
Fort Crook. He’ll be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, while the two men were at breakfast,
Traile was called to the telephone. He returned after five
minutes, his face radiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’T’s all right,” he said. “Commander of Legion called
me up. General got in two hours ago. Already conferred
with governor, city commissioner, police department, everything
else conferrable. Police department transferred to the
colonel, commanding officer at Fort Crook. Already taken
control. All arrests to be military arrests—oh, boy! that
means us! General to see Legion members at ten this
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the mayor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damned if I didn’t forget to ask!” Traile looked at
Stacey remorsefully. “You really do feel badly about the
mayor, don’t you?” he said. “You’re a—a good sort, Captain,
if you don’t mind my impertinence in saying so,” he
concluded impetuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Stacey quietly, “I’m not a good sort. I’m only
mad,—that’s all; and I’m not forgetting why. You’re ten
years younger than I, Traile. You’re rather enjoying
the lark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same,” the other insisted soberly, “you <span class='it'>are</span> sorry
about the mayor, as well as mad. I’ll go call up the
hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better,” he said, when he came back. “Improving
slowly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they set out for the Legion meeting they left behind
them the four N. C. O.’s, in civilian dress, sitting placidly
in the library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” observed Traile exultantly, as he set his car
plunging down the driveway, “it’s not at all a bad thing the
general couldn’t get here till to-day. Because all the conglomerate
skunks of this town didn’t get on to the fact that
we meant business. They’ve had one whole joyful day
with nothing doing but a few troops marching around, and
they’ve fairly laid themselves open with bragging about what
they did Sunday night. One long bright day of practically
handing out their names on a platter. Scores and scores of
’em on the lists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were perhaps three hundred Legion members in the
large room they entered. General Wood appeared almost
at once, the colonel from Fort Crook beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey gazed at the general with interest. A clear honest
face, he thought swiftly, with no appearance either of bitterness
or the autocratic spirit. A good soldier from his record—not
a doubt of it; but why in the world had such a
man chosen to be a soldier, and how had he come through
it looking like that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general wasted no time. “There are long lists of
men implicated in this business,” he said to the three hundred.
“Your job will be to go out and get them. When you
go to make an arrest use no more force than is necessary and
use all the force that is necessary. Remember you are sent
for a certain man. Come back with him. Bring him in
alive if possible. But bring him in. Officers will now report
to Colonel M——.” And the general left the room
abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Stacey and Traile received their lists—ten
names apiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d like just four men for escort—two each, sir, if
it’s all the same to you. May we pick the four?” Traile
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” said the colonel. “Get service revolvers for
yourselves and rifles for your men of the ordnance officer.
Bring your prisoners here to police headquarters as you
get them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” the lieutenant remarked in disgust, as they were
speeding swiftly homeward, with, in the tonneau behind
them, the four men, armed now and in uniform, whom
Stacey had chosen as escort the day before. “Pshaw!
What’s twenty names?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left their guard in the hall of Traile’s house, went
into the library, and copied their lists for the other four
men who were waiting there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Stacey remarked. “Start at it. As soon as
any one’s located send one of your men around to report
to us. And you’d better detail some one to see that he
doesn’t get away in the meantime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said Peters. “I guess you’ll find that all right,
Captain. We’ve worked out a plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you would have, Sergeant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men saluted, for all that they were in civilian clothes,
and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to do but wait. Traile fidgeted, but
Stacey was impassive. Suddenly he smiled. It had occurred
to him that, having learned from the newspaper item
the name of the man he had attempted to strangle Sunday
night, he could easily lay an information against him and
proceed to arrest him—supposing he was sufficiently recovered
to permit of arrest. Stacey smiled (he had a rather
grisly sense of humor) because he could picture the horror
on—what was his name?—Kraft’s brutish face when he saw
his assailant himself come for him. But it was only a diverting
fancy. Stacey did not follow it up. In the matter
of retribution he thought Kraft had had his share.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll take my car, Captain—you can drive a Cadillac,
can’t you?—and I’ll use my father’s,” Traile suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In less than an hour a man reported with an address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go after him, Lieutenant,” said Stacey calmly.
“You’re more in a hurry than I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile went joyfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen minutes later two more were announced to be
located, and, as Stacey was on the point of getting into
Traile’s car with Morgan and Isaacs (his escort), and the
two men who had reported, still another name was
brought in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey went after them. Two he got without difficulty,
disregarding their cringing protestations of innocence with
the same impassive disgust he had shown—except for one
moment—toward the mob on Sunday night. The third, who
was hiding in the back room of a saloon and was encouraged
by the presence of companions, showed fight, until Stacey
rapped him dispassionately on the head with the butt of his
revolver. Stacey took his prisoners to the police station and
returned to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile had already been there and gone again. Two other
men were waiting, and Stacey set off once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful system! Works like a charm. Good man,
Peters! Too bad Burnham can’t be in on it!” he thought
to himself. He wondered once or twice why Monahan
couldn’t come. He felt a little sorry. He had always liked
Monahan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At four o’clock he and Traile had brought the last men
on their lists to the police station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” said the lieutenant, “it’s too easy!—though two
of the ones I got livened things up for a while. Come on!
Let’s ask for more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reported to the colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got all our men, sir,” said Traile, who was spokesman
because he knew the officer personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” the colonel exclaimed. “All twenty! Why, no
one else has got a third through his list yet! Complain they
can’t find their men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were lucky, I guess, sir,” Traile returned. “May we
have some more names?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! Coming in all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They received two further lists, dropped them in their
pockets, and set off once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when in the library each read his own paper through,
Stacey started slightly. There were only nine names on the
copied list that he handed to Peters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At ten that evening they reported once more to the
colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve brought in all but two on my list, sir,” said Traile,
“and Captain Carroll all but three on his. They’re beginning
to get wise and skip out of town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colonel considered the two men curiously. “How on
earth do you do it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile grinned. He had always been irrepressibly unmilitary;
it was why Stacey had liked him. “Just system, sir,”
he replied. “Can you give us some more names?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colonel reflected. “Well, I’ll tell you,” he said finally.
“I’ll make you out a list—one list, since it’s clear you two
work together—of twenty men the others couldn’t get, but
who aren’t supposed to have left the city. Go after them
and see what you can do, but not till to-morrow morning.
Mind! That’s an order! These are a bad lot—crooks,
nearly all of them, the chief of police says. I don’t want any
midnight casualties among Legion men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two took their escort to their homes, then drove back
to the house. But as they got out of the car Stacey paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Traile,” he said, “will you let me have your car for a
little while? There’s some one I want to see. I’ll be back
inside of an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! You know you don’t have to ask.” But Traile
could not conceal his boyish curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you about it soon—by to-morrow, I hope,” Stacey
remarked, climbing back into the car. “You copy out that
list for our men, will you? and tell them we’ll be ready at
seven to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Traile nodded, and Stacey set off. He drove the car
slowly along the avenue until he sighted a policeman, then
drew up beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Dodge Street, please?” he asked. “And where
would eight-sixteen be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer explained carefully, and Stacey drove on. It
was a long way to the street he sought, but he reached it
at last and found the number—a boarding-house in the
section near the railway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is James Monahan in?” he asked the woman who answered
the ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hall bedroom on the third floor,” she replied, looking
suspiciously at his uniform. “I don’t know if he’s in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey went up the stairs and knocked at the door. There
was a kind of growl from inside that might have been meant
for: “Come in”; so Stacey entered the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was a small bare room, at the other end of which, beside
the bed, an enormous red-haired Irishman stood like a herculean
statue. He was bent forward in a half-crouching
attitude and held menacingly at shoulder height, grasped in
both hands, a chair, with the obvious intention of hurling
it at the intruder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey involuntarily started. Then a gleam of appreciation
came into his eye. The man’s attitude was magnificent.
Rodin might have posed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, upon my word, Monahan,” he said easily, “you
give a fellow a cordial reception!” And he dropped into a
chair—the only other one in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man lowered his chair slowly, a look of blank amazement,
changing gradually to gloom, coming over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christ Almighty! Captain!” he muttered finally. “So
it’s <span class='it'>you</span> that’s come to arrest me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is <span class='it'>not</span>!” cried Stacey angrily, “and you ought to know
it isn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man shook his red hair back from his forehead and
stood there, gazing at Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, can’t you?” said Stacey sharply. “You take
up too damned much room that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint smile curved the giant’s mouth and wrinkled the
corners of his eyes. He sat down carefully, the chair creaking
beneath him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey reflected, staring at him thoughtfully. “Monahan,”
he began at last, “I found your name on a list of men
I was to go out and get for that Sunday night row. What’s
the meaning of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Irishman’s face flamed. “I didn’t have a thing to
do with it!” he burst out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hell! I know you didn’t!” said Stacey impatiently.
“You were,” he continued slowly, “the most unmanageable
man in my battalion (and the one I cared most for,” he
added to himself). “You were quarrelsome, you had fits
of sullenness, you made me trouble on an average about
seven days a week, and you broke every rule it was possible
to break, but you wouldn’t any more have been part of a
mob to pick on a <span class='it'>man</span> than you’d have turned tail and run
in an attack. Now what is this charge about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slow smile had spread over Monahan’s vast face.
“That’s a hell of a fine character you’ve given me, Captain
dear!” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be worse. Go on. Clear this thing up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll tell you the whole story, Captain,” he began.
“I don’t hold much with niggers, but I don’t hold neither
with getting five thousand men together—real bold-like—and
going out and lynching one nigger. And Sunday night
when I seen what was doing I was pretty mad. But not half
as mad as I was when right in front of my nose a bunch of
white-livered sons of bitches got hold of the mayor, who
was acting like a man, and strung him up—by God! strung
him up to a pole! I was there, Captain, and I pitched in
and I fought the dirtiest I knew how—’n’ you know whether
we was trained to fight dirty or not. And by ’n’ by I
kicked one man in the guts and another in the knee—me
getting madder ’n’ madder because all th’ time there was the
mayor swinging and twitching up there—but some one else
got up the pole ’n’ cut him down before I could get there,
’n’ then some damn cold-blooded skunk of a photographer
took a flash-light picture, ’n’ then all of a sudden there’s
Sergeant McCarthy of the <span class='it'>po</span>lice beside me, ’n’ he says:
‘By God! Monahan! I didn’t think it of you!’ So there I
am in the photograph at headquarters ’s clear as life, and
there’s McCarthy to testify I was one of them that lynched
th’ mayor.” He paused, an expression of resentment and
resignation on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey considered him thoughtfully. “Why don’t you go
around to police headquarters, give yourself up, and tell
the truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monahan shook his head. “There wouldn’t anybody believe
me, Captain,” he said sullenly. “ ‘Fat story, me lad,
with <span class='it'>your</span> record!’ they’d say. They’d laugh at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean—‘your record’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been twice in the jug, Captain, since I got back,” the
Irishman growled, “and I’ll tell you about that, too, if you’ll
listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I got back from across—and I wish to God I’d
never come back!—I got me a job at the packing-house.
Well, who should I find for my foreman but a white-livered
skunk called Barton? ’N’ I’ll tell you about Barton, too.
Barton, he got exempted from the draft as being the sole
support of one poor aged mother ’n’ two poor little sisters.
Now the truth about that skunk was, so help me God! that
he never done one thing for them—not a red cent had he
given them for years, Captain! All the little they had come
to them from a brother’s son of the old lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that ain’t all—not half, Captain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monahan paused and thrust his shaggy red head forward.
His eyes gleamed dangerously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a girl, Captain, when I went away,” he went on,
in a deep rumbling voice, “and a good girl she was. But
this Barton, he comes shining around and shining around,
’n’ she falls for him like a little fool, ’n’ after a while he
goes ’n’ marries her,—which he wouldn’t have done, Barton
wouldn’t, if it hadn’t been that she had two brothers, big
strong up-standing men who sort of urged him on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, when I see this skunk there for my foreman things
just busted up inside me, ’n’ the very first day at th’ noon
hour I laid for him in a quiet place in the yard and I says:
‘Now fight, you God-damned, white-livered son of a bastard
German skunk!’ ’N’ Barton hollered for help and a lot
of men come running, but not before I’d handled him a little
rough—though not half what I could have done with more
time. Well, would you believe it, Captain? for that little
bit of righteous trifling th’ judge give me six days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aggrieved innocence in the Irishman’s face was too
much. Stacey struggled, then gave up and burst out laughing.
“Go on! Go on, Jim!” he cried at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monahan, too, had laughed, finally, but at Stacey’s words
his face grew dark again. “When I come out,” he continued
angrily, “I went back for my job, ’n’ they wouldn’t give it
to me, the rotten skunks! ’N’ they’d blacklisted me, too.
Not another job in any packing-house could I get.” He
paused, with a growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey considered him, at once sympathetically and curiously.
He noted that in recounting the damning evidence of
the flash-light picture and McCarthy’s misinterpretation of
his presence at the lynching, Monahan had displayed only a
melancholy resentment against fate; it was his later discovery
that an organization was against him which shook
him with anger. Now McCarthy’s remark had been grossly
unjust, and the attitude of Monahan’s employers was not
altogether so; yet Stacey understood the distinction—understood
it emotionally. His heart went out to Monahan.
They were kin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Irishman continued his tale. “ ’N’ then I said
I’d do them dirt, ’n’ I done it, Captain. There was a strike
among the boys before long, ’n’ ’twas me more than any
other that brought it about. ’N’ they knew ’twas me, the
dirty packers! but never a thing could they get on me. ’N’
th’ strike cost them money—the only thing that hurts a
packer, Captain. Then there were scabs ’n’ fighting, ’n’ I
couldn’t keep out of it, ’n’ that time they caught me, ’n’ the
judge—a decent sort of man and not knowing the rights of
the story neither—give me a month, ’n’ they was sore because
they couldn’t fix it so I’d get five years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’N’ that’s all, Captain. But you can see how I can’t go
to the <span class='it'>po</span>lice, quiet-like, ’n’ tell them th’ truth about Sunday
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey saw. He meditated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, look here!” he said at last. “I didn’t say anything
about you or why I didn’t bring you in, but Traile” (when
he spoke to Monahan Stacey did not say “Lieutenant
Traile”) “Traile, though he didn’t know your name was on
my list, happened to say something that would lead the
authorities to believe you’d left town, along with a good
many others. Why don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno,” replied the Irishman sullenly. “I didn’t like
to beat it as if I’d really been one of them skunks that
lynched th’ mayor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you have money? Because I can—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord bless you, yes, Captain!” the man interrupted.
“The boys come ’n’ offered me all I’d’ve needed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey gazed at him. “D’you mean that <span class='it'>our</span> boys did
that?” he demanded. “Peters and Swanson and Petitvalle
and the rest of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure they did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, damn it all! they’ve known about this charge
against you ever since I got them together, and not one of
them’s come to me and told me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monahan grinned. “Sure not, Captain!” he replied.
“They done what you told them to, because you’re you, ’n’,
as far as I can see, they’re enjoying themselves doing it, it
not being what you might call strictly according to rule. But
they didn’t any of them come ’n’ lay their curly heads on
your breast ’n’ sob out their own little troubles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey fumed, then got over it, and fell into thought.
Here were these men who’d go to hell with him—at least,
Burnham had said they would—yet he couldn’t get at them,
not really. What difficult secret souls they had! He sighed.
Yet somehow he was proud of their reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides,” Monahan remarked, as a final shot, “I give
them orders they was to say nothing to you about me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you did!” said Stacey drily. “You’ve been giving
too many orders. It’s my turn. Now listen to me, you
damned red-headed fire-brand! To-morrow afternoon I’ll
try to see General Wood and I’ll tell him about you. He’s
a square man and white, and I think he’ll fix the thing up.
But, just in case he shouldn’t, you’ll decamp, beat it, quit
this lovely city, right now. And you’ll take money from me
to do that. (Confound it!” he reflected, “I’ll have to borrow
money from Traile to get home myself!) And you’ll
let me know where you are, but not till to-morrow night, so
that <span class='it'>I</span> won’t know when I see the general.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A broad grin had spread over Monahan’s face, giving it an
expression of gigantic good humor. “Faith! Captain,” he
drawled, with a touch of brogue in his intonation, “as an
example of sacred military discipline you’re in a class by
yourself, you are! An Irishman you are at heart, Captain.
And it’s sorry I am to have to disobey you. But I’d feel
fine, wouldn’t I? to have General Wood saying sternly:
‘And where is this man, Captain Carroll?’ and you replying
sweetly: ‘I gave him money ’n’ told him to quit the town,
General!’ No, no, Captain! Right here will I sit ’n’
wait for you to come ’n’ say: ‘All is forgiven, Jim dear!’
or for the <span class='it'>po</span>lice to come ’n’ get me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, half furious, half delighted, capitulated. “Oh,
well,” he said, “I hope you’ll go out and get something to
eat now and then.” He rose to go, then paused. “Look
here! You told me about all this. Why couldn’t you have
told Traile?” he asked curiously. “He’s a good sort and
he knows every one here. He’d have cleared things up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the expression of sullen hostility had returned to
Monahan’s face. “Traile’s decent enough, but a swell,”
he growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rot! Traile’s father’s rich; so’s mine. No difference
at all. I’m a swell, too,” Stacey observed, almost gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can call yourself names at your pleasure, Captain,”
said Monahan, “but let any one else say that about you and
I’ll break his head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed and departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Traile found more zest in their work next day.
Not being fools, they accepted Peters’ quiet advice that all
six of them make the arrests together. Even so, they had
their hands full. These, thought Stacey grimly more than
once, were the men they were after. Four they took, with
difficulty, in the attic of a disreputable boarding-house, four
in a brothel, and five on a river barge after a running fight
during which Traile got a knife thrust in his arm and Jackson
a bullet in the shoulder. The rest they picked up
separately or in pairs. But by five in the afternoon they
had got them all—all twenty. Tired and grimy, Traile with
his arm in a sling, they reported to the colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work, gentlemen! Good work!” he said soberly.
“You even got Voorhies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did, sir,” replied Traile quietly, “but with two bullets
in him, which the captain here put there on my account.
Two of our men are hurt—Jackson shot in the shoulder—at
the hospital—will be all right; Morgan laid out with a brick—came
around after a while—a bit groggy now, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, sir. A scratch. Hardly notice it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve done well. I’ll let the general know. I think this
ends it. You can retire into the bosoms of your families
and cease calling me ‘sir’—always a strain on National Army
men, I observe. Congratulations, Captain Carroll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Colonel,” Stacey replied. “There was a
favor I wanted to ask, sir,” he added. “Do you think it
would be possible for me to see General Wood for a very
few minutes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find out,” said the colonel. “I feel sure he’ll be glad
to see you.” And he left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell you all about it when I come out, Traile,” Stacey
remarked abstractedly, thinking over what words he
should use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way, Captain,” said the colonel, returning presently.
He led Stacey down a hall to a door at which he
knocked. He opened it, and Stacey went through, alone,
into the room beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a large office-room, with in the centre a desk, at the
further side of which General Wood was seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey saluted stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the general rose and held out his hand across the
desk. “Come in, Captain Carroll,” he said, with his pleasant
smile, and shook Stacey’s hand. “Sit down. I see you wear
the D. S. C. ribbon. My congratulations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general considered him. “I’m glad you asked to see
me, Captain,” he continued, sitting back in his chair, “because
Colonel M—— has just told me of the extraordinary
success you and Lieutenant Traile have had in
making arrests. I have an entirely unmilitary curiosity to
know how you did it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, sir,” said Stacey, “we didn’t really play fair. It
happens that, though I’m not from Omaha, twenty-two of
my men live here. I organized twenty of them, sir, and had
sixteen of them go out in civilian clothes and locate the
men on our lists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general stared, then began to smile. Finally he
laughed—a pleasant kindly laugh. “Most unmilitary,” he
remarked, “but efficient.” Suddenly he became thoughtful.
“And your men were willing to do that for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s unusual. You say twenty out of the twenty-two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. One of the other two is in bed with pneumonia.
It’s about the twenty-second man that I should like
to speak to you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name is Monahan, sir, a wild Irishman, the most
difficult man I ever had and the best. He was on my second
list of men to arrest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad! You arrested him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general’s face grew grave. “Why not?” he inquired
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he is totally innocent, sir,” Stacey returned
steadily, “but couldn’t prove it in court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll waive for a moment your action in not carrying
out orders. How do you know he’s innocent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, sir, with all his unruliness, this is exactly the
sort of thing he <span class='it'>couldn’t</span> do. And, besides, he told me the
real story himself. He wouldn’t lie to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Stacey very swiftly repeated Monahan’s story. As
he did so, he watched the general’s face closely. A little
gleam, Stacey thought, came into the candid blue eyes at
the mention of Monahan’s black-listing. Leonard Wood,
too, knew what it meant to be a man against a combination.
When Stacey had finished the general made some hasty
notes on a scratch-block. Then he looked up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you brought this matter up to me, Captain,” he
said soberly. “I’ll see to it that the charge against Monahan
is dismissed. I want every man punished who was implicated
in Sunday night’s shameful affair; I don’t want any
man dragged into it on account of something else he may
have done. No taking advantage of this to settle old scores.
However,” he concluded, with a smile, “you can’t expect me
to approve officially of your action, can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not, sir,” said Stacey cheerfully. He rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the general detained him. “Captain,” he asked, his
mouth twitching slightly, “when you were in the service
did you frequently employ your—er—admirable spirit of
personal initiative?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” said Stacey calmly. “Only once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And—excuse my curiosity!—was it because of that occasion
that you received your decoration?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, sir, quite decidedly not!” answered Stacey
reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general laughed and stood up. “Good-bye, Captain
Carroll, and thanks,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir,” returned Stacey. They shook hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Traile,” he said, a moment later. “Let’s drive
like the devil over to Monahan’s place—on Dodge Street it
is. I’ll tell you all about it on the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, with nothing left for him to do, apathy descended on
Stacey. Despite Traile’s pleading he would not remain after
the next night, when he took a late train for Vernon. He
did not want to see Traile any longer. He did not want to
see any one. He desired only to get away from this city.
But he did not for a moment fancy that the train would
carry him to any place better or even different. All life was
like that. You travelled and travelled and got nowhere.
One of those amusement booths where you sat perfectly still
and received an illusion of motion from a painted landscape
rolled swiftly past you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>If Stacey had been at all curious about himself he would
probably have thought that his Omaha adventure had left
him precisely as he was before. He might only have been
concerned at the memory of the sudden ungovernable passion
to which he had fallen a prey on the night of the lynching.
But he was not interested in himself, even faintly.
Impressions of others and, especially, impressions of things
flowed in upon him, since that was the way he was made,
but chaotically, since he did not seek them or try consciously
to arrange them. He was apathetic but not weary. He saw
life as flashes of lightning in chaos. Or, no, the figure was
too grandiose. Sparks travelling with haphazard chain-like
velocity in the soot of a chimney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a wash-out on the road, and Stacey’s train was
delayed for many hours, so that he did not reach Vernon
until late in the afternoon. He hired a taxi and drove home.
It was the fashionable hour. Vernon had certainly become
metropolitan of late years. The streets were thronged, and
the handsome boulevard into which the taxi presently turned
was a river of gleaming motor cars, chauffeur in livery on
the front seat, perfectly gowned women in the tonneau.
Smooth, very! The mellow October coolness in the air
and the lights that began to shine palely against the sunset
played up to it. People waved to Stacey, smiling at his
plebeian conveyance, and he lifted his hat abstractedly. But
at heart he was full of a sick distaste for all this elegance,
this physical luxury, that seemed to him not so much to
hide as to reveal what lay beneath—the vulgarity, the
stupidity, the greed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arrived at home, he bathed and dressed, then went down
to the library, where he sipped a high-ball moodily and
waited for his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll’s handsome face lighted up at sight of his
son. “Well, well, this is fine!” he exclaimed. “When did
you get back? And what have you been doing in that disgraceful
place all this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I saw the riot,” said Stacey, shaking hands, “and
stayed on for the sequel. May I get you a high-ball,
sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Come into the dining-room. I’ll mix a cocktail.
Parker will have had the ice all ready. We can talk at the
same time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey watched him as he measured out the gin and
vermouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Disgraceful, the whole business!” Mr. Carroll went on,
emphasizing his words by a vigorous agitation of the silver
shaker. “There’s never been a time in the history of this
country when respect for law and order was at so low an
ebb.” He poured his cocktail into a glass and took it over
to the table. “Come on, son,” he said, “sit down. Dinner
will be served in a few minutes, I dare say. Sit down and
tell me the whole story. Your health, my boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir,” said Stacey, obeying. “But there isn’t
very much to tell. I’ll spare you details of the lynching
itself—they were in all your papers, of course. After the
riot the Legion men organized, and, as I happened to have
my uniform with me, I went in with them and helped arrest
a lot of the people implicated. Young Traile and I worked
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll sat up straight, his eyes shining. “You did
that? Good for you, Stacey! Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey related his experiences, stressing details which
seemed unimportant to himself, such as his and the lieutenant’s
adventures in making the arrests, and omitting to speak
of Monahan, because he thought his father would not approve
of his behavior in that matter, and Stacey, though with
a sort of melancholy absence of feeling, wanted to be agreeable
to his father. Parker had served the soup, but Mr.
Carroll, though he prized dinner highly, left it untouched
until Stacey had finished speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” he cried then, “good! I’m proud of you. But,
hang it!” he added boyishly, “how adventures do dog you
about, don’t they? So General Wood was the man for the
job? I knew he’d prove to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good man!” remarked Mr. Carroll, eating his soup
now. “I hope he’ll be our next president.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope so, too,” Stacey assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll’s face was radiant. “Glad you feel the same
way about it. We’ve had enough of the waste and radicalism
and shilly-shallying of this administration,” he asserted.
“We want a strong safe man for president, representing a
decent party. General Wood fills the bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Stacey thoughtlessly, “I don’t care anything
about all that. One party seems to me as silly as the other.
I only want General Wood to be elected president because I
suppose he wants to <span class='it'>be</span> president and I’d like him to have
whatever he wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at these words the elation had vanished from Mr.
Carroll’s face. It looked grave now and sad. Stacey bit his
lip. Why the devil, he thought angrily, couldn’t he have kept
his mouth shut? He didn’t seem to have decent control
over his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure he’d make a good president,” he said apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they could neither of them keep off from subjects
on which they disagreed, these being nearly all conceivable
subjects except their unreasoning mutual affection, which
would not have lent itself especially well to conversation
even had Mr. Carroll not been shy and Stacey intensely
reserved. It was Mr. Carroll’s turn next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that business, that damnable riot,” he said, as though
involuntarily, a fanatical gleam in his eye, “I felt sure at
the time that there was Bolshevism behind it. Did you see
any evidence of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” returned Stacey drily. He tried to keep his
tone expressionless, knowing that his father literally couldn’t
help making the remark—the thing was an obsession; but he
probably, in spite of himself, revealed the disdain his father
must have known the question would arouse in him. The
rest of the dinner passed off in a dreary attempt to revive
the faded cordiality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterward they went into the living-room, and Stacey
walked restlessly about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A game of pinochle, son?” Mr. Carroll suggested
presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, no, sir. I’ve really got to go out and make
a call,” Stacey returned. He knew he was being cruel.
There was a faint wistfulness about his father that touched
Stacey dully; but he simply could not endure the repression
he must exert upon himself if he were to stay there and
talk with his father. All his words would have to be
studied, never casual. He was incapable of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Mr. Carroll. “You’ve been away a week.
Of course there are people you want to see. I’ll read a little
while, then go up to bed. Good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, sir,” said Stacey, and left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the hall outside he hesitated for a moment, and
when he had gone to the garage and brought out his car he
stopped it beside the house and returned to the living-room.
He saw, as he opened the door, that his father was not
reading but playing solitaire, and this, too, touched Stacey a
little. Mr. Carroll looked up in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to run over to see Phil and Catherine Blair for
a little while,” Stacey said. “They don’t even know where
I’ve been, and I ought to go. It occurred to me, sir, that
just possibly you’d like to drive over there with me. Would
you care to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had not the slightest idea that his father would
accept. Mr. Carroll disliked going out in the evening. But,
to Stacey’s surprise, he dropped his cards and rose at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, son, I’ll be glad to go along, if you really want
me,” he replied. “I like your friends, the Blairs,” he added,
in an apologetic tone, when he and Stacey were in the car.
“Phil’s a thoughtful fellow, with talent, too, I should judge,
though I don’t pretend to know anything about architecture.
And Catherine’s a fine girl, an unusual girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Stacey was surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil himself opened the door, a look of warm pleasure
glowing in his face. “Well, where the deuce have you been,
Stacey?” he cried. “This is awfully good of you, Mr. Carroll!
Come in! Come in!” And he ushered them into
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sitting-room glowed, too. Light from a shaded
reading-lamp fell on Catherine’s hair and face, illuminating
the fine close-grained skin and accentuating the firm bony
structure beneath it. Catherine was sitting in a low easy
chair, over the arms of which her two sons leaned closely to
gaze down at the large book that lay open on her knees.
She rose swiftly at sight of her guests, but with a shy grace.
Her hand went to her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the two boys, they dashed at Stacey immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For just an instant, while he held them off, he considered
the scene wistfully. It all seemed so far from any mood his
tortured inharmonious spirit was able to achieve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Catherine, after a faint smile at him, was shaking
hands with his father, and the boys were growing
importunate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Uncle Stacey!” Carter shouted. “Do ‘Fly
away, Jack!’ for him! Come on! Over here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carter! Carter!” said his mother. “Not so loud! And
let Uncle Stacey alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but he wants to play, don’t you, Uncle Stacey?”
Carter insisted, moderating his voice, however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” said Stacey. “Only wouldn’t you—er—just as
lief try some other game?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. ‘Fly away, Jack!’ ” the boy returned firmly. “I do
it for <span class='it'>him</span> sometimes, and he can’t ever find them. Only,”
he added in a tremendous whisper, “they come off kind
of often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey set patiently about the game, In a way it was a
relief—like knitting, he supposed. But, as he played it, he
heard his father at the other end of the room proudly telling
Phil and Catherine of the Omaha adventure, and an odd
dream-like sensation came over Stacey of not knowing
which was real—this, the childish game with the boys, or
that, the story his father was repeating. Neither, perhaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil came over and stood near him. “A sad day for you
that you introduced that game!” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know! I don’t mind it,” Stacey returned.
“ ‘Come back, Jack! Come back, Jill!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“Did I really introduce it?” he thought hazily. “Was it
really I or some ancestor of mine?”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dreadful monotony of it!” Phil added, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s its charm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough! That will do now,” said Phil presently. “Up
you go, boys! To bed! Run! Beat it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat it! Beat it!” Jack repeated delightedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother won’t let <span class='it'>me</span> say ‘beat it,’ ” Carter remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t she? Well, I suppose she’ll let me say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carter rushed across the room. “Mother! Mother!” he
cried, both on the way and after arrival, “daddy says you’ll
let him say ‘beat it!’ Will you? Then why won’t you
let me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sh!” said Catherine, looking a little dazed. “Carter, this
is Uncle Stacey’s father. What will he think of you if you
shout that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy shook Mr. Carroll’s extended hand politely.
“But, mother,” he repeated, “daddy said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. You tell daddy that I say he’s a great
goose and that geese can say what they please, I suppose.
Then run up to bed and see if you can help Jack undress
nicely. I’ll come up and kiss you both good night when
you’re ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys went—reluctantly, with dragging steps, but
without protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, at the door Carter turned and ran back, his
brother following like a faithful dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I forgot to say thank you, Uncle Stacey, for
Jack and Jill,” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, Carter,” said Stacey. “ ’Night! Sleep
tight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let the bed-bugs bite!” Carter shouted joyfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carter!” called his mother, but he was really gone
this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Triumphant exit, wasn’t it?” Phil remarked. “Come out
on the porch with me, Stacey. It will rest you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out and walked up and down together. There
was a pleasant coolness in the air. The city glittered beneath
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry you ran into all that mess in Omaha,” Phil said
presently. “Must have given you a rotten sense of discouragement.”
He waited, as though for a reply, but Stacey
made none. “The trouble with crowds is, I suppose,” he
continued thoughtfully, “that you get only the least common
denominator. What all men have in common is their primitive
passions. It’s only what each has by himself that counts
to his credit. Any man is better than a crowd.” He
paused again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt,” said Stacey dispassionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Blair ceased walking, leaned back against the railing
of the porch, and considered Stacey, with a smile. “By
the way,” he remarked irrelevantly, “yesterday I got a statement
of receipts and disbursements from the Fund for
Viennese Children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey frowned. “Oh, you did!” he said drily. “And
how did you happen to get it? I can guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” Phil returned simply, “Catherine and I send what
we can.” He laughed a pleasant laugh. “You hypocrite!”
he exclaimed. “Oh, you damned hypocrite!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey shook his head. “It’s no use gunning around in me
for virtue, Phil,” he said quietly. “What I gave them hasn’t
at all the meaning of what you’ve given them, whatever that
may be. I’ve kept out two hundred a month for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shucks!” Phil exclaimed disgustedly. “You’re becoming
puerile, Stacey! Do you think I care about the amount—if
any—of self-sacrifice that you showed? The only thing
that interests me is that <span class='it'>you</span> were interested in the suffering
of Viennese children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey gazed away absently at the gleaming city. “I
don’t see anything strange about that,” he said finally.
“There’s been enough suffering in the world, especially
among children. You think, Phil, that I have some malevolent
philosophy of life. You’re mistaken. I haven’t any
philosophy. It’s only that every day I run across suffering—so
much of it—that’s caused deliberately. Then I get a
craving to destroy. That’s all,” he concluded listlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much deliberately as stupidly,” Phil murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey was walking up and down again. Presently
he paused before the large window that opened into
the sitting-room. He gazed in at Catherine and his
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil, who had followed Stacey and stood now at his
shoulder, smiled. “That always seems to me an unfair
advantage to take of people,” he said, “to watch them when
they don’t know you’re there—like looking at them in their
sleep. No,—worse than that. For their personality is one
thing when it’s focussed on you, quite another focussed on
some one else. You’re not meant to see the other. It contains
no adaptation to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why it’s a relief,” Stacey returned. “For a brief
moment you get the sense of being yourself abolished, and
experience peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” said Phil reflectively. “Also,” he added, after a
pause, “I dare say this matter of personal adaptation to the
individual accounts for the emptiness of talk—and thought—in
a group. The adaptation is necessarily lacking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled faintly. “Always thorough, Phil, aren’t
you?” he observed. He had a strange shadowy sense of
being back in his old pre-war relationship to Phil. There
was pleasure in this for Stacey, but melancholy also, since
he knew it was an illusion. He continued to gaze in through
the window at his father and Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll was leaning forward in his chair, with a certain
courtliness, and smiling; Catherine’s face in the light
from the electric lamp appeared mobile and full of expression.
They seemed to be talking freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw Catherine so bold before,” Stacey remarked
finally, turning away. “I swear I’m jealous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” Phil returned quietly, “she’s always shyer with you
than with any one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she? That’s silly. Now what do you suppose they’re
talking about?” asked Stacey idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Blair smiled. “You, no doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horrid thought! Come on! Let’s go in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were watching you from outside the window,” he
announced maliciously, as they reëntered the room. Catherine
flushed. “Phil said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, shut up, Stacey!” Phil interrupted. “I won’t have
my wife teased. By the way, your friend, Mrs. Latimer,
has been here a number of times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was interested. “You like her, Catherine?” he
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much,” she replied, the old shyness back again,
stronger than ever, in voice and face. Perhaps she was
vexed with it and struggled against it, for: “The last time
she came she brought her daughter, Mrs. Price, with her,”
Catherine added, then bit her lip, lest she should have said
something awkward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marian?” Stacey exclaimed. But he was not perturbed.
He had forgotten Marian completely in the last week. He
was merely surprised; for he somehow could not fancy
Marian and Catherine together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Latimer is a fine woman, with an affected idiot of
a husband,” Mr. Carroll observed. “Can’t say I care much
for Marian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled, almost imperceptibly. What a straightforward
loyal character his father had, he thought. Everything
clear, black-and-white. And never more kindly than
here now with Phil and Catherine. Stacey had a feeling of
looking at his father from a long way off—or—or—at the
reflection of him in a mirror. What an odd blurred evening—and
pleasant! He fell into a reverie while the others
talked. Why should there be this wistfulness about his
father? Mr. Carroll had a strong personality; he could
manage men; decisions snapped, clean-cut, from his mind.
Perhaps he was wistful because he had no grown-up life
outside of business. His ideas on general subjects were
immature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before long Mr. Carroll rose. “Come on, Stacey!”
he remarked. “Phil has to go to work early to-morrow, and
Catherine must be tired, too. You don’t mind a grandfather
calling you by your first name?” he asked her, with a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Night, Phil!” said Stacey at the door, and shook his
friend’s hand casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice people, very!” his father observed, after they had
driven for some minutes in silence. “But I don’t think Phil
looks well, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?” returned Stacey, surprised. “I thought he seemed
gayer to-night than for a long while. He’s always been
atrociously thin, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the strange soft sense of haziness vanished in the
night. Next morning, after breakfast, Stacey stood looking
absently out of his study window, with no sense but of a
poignant emptiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker came up after a time to say that Mrs. Latimer had
called to see him; but even at this Stacey felt nothing save
a little surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went down at once and greeted Mrs. Latimer pleasantly.
She looked, he thought, rather worn, faintly older;
but he said to himself that this was probably the effect of
the cruel morning light. Moreover, as soon as she spoke and
smiled, the impression vanished, as carelessly as it
had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you don’t want to see me or you’d have come
to my house,” she said, “but I really wanted to see you, so
I couldn’t resist coming. Silly, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” he replied. “An excellent idea. What the
Italians call <span class='it'>geniale</span>. Piquant, too, with just a touch of
impropriety about it, since if we had been of the same age
we’d undoubtedly have married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was merely saying words, letting them say themselves,
but Mrs. Latimer flushed like a girl. “Stacey!” she cried.
“Shame on you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on up to my study, if you don’t mind climbing
the stairs,” he suggested. “That will make it still worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, and they went up. But when they had sat
down they both became silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s Marian and the new ménage?” Stacey asked,
after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer gave him a quick curious glance, but there
was nothing except polite interest in his face and tone. Nor,
indeed, was there more than that in his thoughts. He asked
after Marian because she had been recalled to his mind the
night before and because Mrs. Latimer was her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell the truth, I don’t know,” she replied. “I don’t
think Marian is particularly happy, but then I don’t think
she ever was. Marian is enigmatic because she has two
such different sides to her nature that neither can be the
truth about her. And what that truth is, I, for one, have
long since given up trying to discover. Marian seems to me
to drift, rather carelessly and recklessly, as though she were
saying: ‘What does it matter? It’s not really I who am
drifting.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey showed some interest in this. “That’s rather profound,”
he observed appreciatively. “Hope you don’t do
that sort of thing with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer smiled. “I have to,” she remarked, “since
you won’t.” Again there was a silence. “Stacey,” she said
abruptly, “I’m so very sorry you happened into that terrible
affair in Omaha. It seems to me sometimes that some ugly
fate is dogging you, to single out everything evil and say:
‘Here! Don’t overlook this! Here’s something really horrid!’
It isn’t fair! It simply isn’t fair!” she concluded,
almost passionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey raised his eyebrows. “It’s awfully good of you to
be so considerate of me,” he replied. “I appreciate it.”
(And, indeed, he tried to.) “Philip Blair said the same
thing last evening—by the way, I’m very glad you’ve taken
to going around there—but really there’s nothing to be perturbed
about. I’m not changed by Omaha. This was no
worse than a thousand things I saw, almost daily, in France.
Worse? It was nothing!” Suddenly his face twitched.
“If you’d seen my friend, Gryce, die!” He drew his hand
across his forehead. “Come!” he said. “One doesn’t talk
of things like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer’s face had looked perplexed and doubtful
at Stacey’s initial coolness; it became grave again and affectionately
apprehensive now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t,” she said gently, “that anything you have seen
is worse than what you saw in France. It is only the persistent
hammering on the same theme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he replied, in a hard voice, “I suppose you think
I’m being steadily turned into some kind of red revolutionary.
Not at all! Quite the opposite, in fact. When I
see what there is in men beneath the crust I’m all for preserving
the crust—any old crust—the one we’ve got, even!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at him sadly. “I wish you’d go away for a
while,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away?” he returned. “I can’t go away from myself,
can I? I’m just like the rest—with a crust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly one of his hot unreasoning rages swept over
him, like a physical thing climbing from his feet to his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no good to do away with myself,” he said in an odd
resonant voice, but not loud. “That’s too little. I’d blow up
everything with myself—every one—my father with his
bigoted prehistoric ideas, your husband with his petulant
selfishness, Marian, stony at one moment, sentimentalizing
prettily over a rose-petal the next,—all men, all women!
And rebuild things? Never! Let them go smash, end,
vanish, and leave clean empty space!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She trembled before his fierceness, but shook her head
courageously. “No,” she said, with brave obstinacy, “you
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” he demanded wildly. “Do you think I’ve got
any pity in me? Never a drop!” The hot wave of anger
passed now, leaving in Stacey only a sick feeling of enhanced
emptiness. There were drops of sweat on his
forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Mrs. Latimer shook her head. “No, I know you
haven’t—not at present. But you wouldn’t do it because
you’re too courageous. You wouldn’t give up in that way.
In spite of you, your strong soul will insist that, bad as
everything is, you’ll see what can be done with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” he asked dully. “It’s all a rotten mess. There’s
no scheme—no one—behind it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say there was,” she answered steadily. “I only
say that any one as strong as you must make a scheme
himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both silent for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive my violence,” said Stacey apologetically at last.
“I get these silly fits when I lose my self-control once in a
while. Idleness, they come from, I suppose. Lack of
anything to do to work off energy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling genuinely embarrassed, he had not been looking
at Mrs. Latimer while he spoke. Looking at her now, he
was amazed to note the sorrow in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away, Stacey!” she murmured. “Go away for a
while. I’m—afraid for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away?” he repeated, but gently this time. “Where
to? Can you find me access to another planet? Nevertheless,”
he added, “I will go if you want me to. Also I note
that the pageant season is on now. It will always be something
to avoid that. What is it this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer laughed hysterically. “ ‘V-Vernon, Past
and—Present.’ The—the whole story of Vernon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now fancy!” said Stacey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It occurred to Stacey, however, that he had spent more than
he could afford lately and had nothing with which to go on
his travels. And this seemed an excellent excuse for remaining
at home. But he presently recollected that on one
War Christmas his father had made him a gift of Liberty
bonds. He sold one, with a sense of resignation. He did
not feel irony in the ease with which he could solve all
financial difficulties, for the idea of personal virtue,
asceticism, was absent from his mind. He was sending all
that money to Vienna because he wanted to send it, not
because he felt he ought to; he kept out two hundred dollars
a month because he wanted them; and he sold a thousand-dollar
bond now simply because if he was to go on a journey
he needed money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is much more difficult to understand why he was going
on a journey at all. He was not affectionate enough to be
going simply because Mrs. Latimer had asked him to. And
one can hardly take seriously the reason he gave his
sister, Julie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drove around to her house the afternoon before his
departure, and on his way caught sight of Irene Loeffler
walking briskly toward him and signalling violently. He
waved his hat, but dashed by her in a burst of speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, Julie,” he said, a few minutes later, sprawling
on the davenport in his sister’s living-room, “it’s all due
to you that I’m going away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely! You lure me to your house, and then you
turn an unscrupulous woman loose on me, and she makes my
life unbearable, and I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” cried Julie, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Who?</span>” Stacey returned. “Who but Irene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julie giggled. “Wh-what in the world has Irene done
to you?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat up straight and gazed at his sister. “Jul-ia,” he
said, “you know me to be modest, you know how little I
esteem my personal charm, caring more for simple things
such as goodness and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” Julie interrupted, “I know all that! I want to
hear about Irene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore,” he continued, “when, from never having
seen the lady at all, I began to see her almost daily, and,
when I didn’t see her, to get invitations to functions given
by her or functions at which she was to be present, it was
long before I suspected purpose in all this. But, Julie, though
modest I am not a fool. Things have now reached such a
point that I cannot take a walk in the park or motor anywhere
without meeting Irene. And I tell you there is evil
design in all this, and I’m going away.” Julie was giggling
increasingly. “Only five minutes ago I evaded her—but
not for long. My senses are growing as abnormally acute
as those of Roderick Usher in Poe’s story.” He paused
and listened apprehensively. “And, in his words, ‘I tell
you that she now stands without the door!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the door bell did, indeed, ring. Stacey
sprang up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see? Good-bye, Julie! I’m going out the back
way,” he concluded, and fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Julie, she threw herself down on the davenport
and laughed helplessly, in which position Irene presently
found her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one seeing Stacey with his sister could have reconciled
him with the Stacey who set himself against society and flew
into passions at his impotence to destroy. Yet there was no
pose in his attitude toward her. Pose demands a marked
consciousness of self, and this he was assuredly without.
He behaved in that way because he felt that way when he
was with Julie, which was not so very often; and he was
obscurely grateful to her for making him feel so. He liked
his sister better than in the old days. She had an ingenuous
manner that concealed a rich sense of humor, and he was
inclined to think that this was characteristic of her attitude
toward all things, that, though her surface simplicity was
unassumed, beneath it lay, not indeed a deliberate philosophy,
but a mature apprehension of life. But he did not
waste much thought on analysis of Julie; he accepted her
as a pleasant fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, then, set off for New York the next afternoon.
Julie was at the train to bid him good-bye, and so was Jimmy
Prout, who tossed a book into his brother-in-law’s lap, and
sat down opposite him. Stacey considered Jimmy’s agreeable
face. Jimmy did no one any harm; on the contrary,
he did people good by being such a companionable person.
Why, thought Stacey, couldn’t <span class='it'>he</span> be like Jimmy? If turbulence
of mind solved anything, got one anywhere, there
would be something to say for it; since it didn’t, since it led
only to impotent fuming, what was the use of it? But, even
at the moment of putting the question to himself, Stacey was
disconsolately aware that he might as well ask what was the
use of the tides, since they only moved back and forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, Stacey,” Julie was saying, “I’m over thirty,
but every time I see any one off on the train I feel thirteen.
I feel a positively aching desire to go too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on along,” he returned. “Nobody I’d like better
to have with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s nice of you, Stacey,” she said gratefully. “I
would. I’d come just this way, without a thing, if it weren’t
for Junior—he’s having whooping-cough. I’ve always
wanted to do something impetuous like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you now?” asked Stacey, mildly surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Julie, who was sitting next the window of her
brother’s section, suddenly gasped and burst into laughter.
“Oh, Jimmy, Stacey, please, please, help me stop!” she cried,
in a smothered voice, pressing her handkerchief against her
mouth. “Oh, she <span class='it'>mustn’t</span> see me in this state!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who mustn’t?” demanded her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I-Irene Loeffler. She—she’s come to see Stacey off,”
Julie stammered weakly. “She’ll be in the car in a moment.
Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy laughed, too, and Julie made a tremendous effort
at self-control, as Irene strode briskly down the car and
paused beside them. She held a book in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” she said abruptly. “Who’s going away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” and “he is,” returned Stacey and Jimmy, who
had risen politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so? Where you going? Sit down! Sit down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“New York first,” Stacey answered cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Irene dropped into the seat beside Jimmy and crossed
her legs. “I was looking for Effie Prince,” she remarked
casually. “Supposed to be leaving on this train. Most
likely couldn’t get her trunks packed in time. Never can.
Here! <span class='it'>You</span> take the book I brought for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Stacey. “Then you’re not going away?
Sorry! I hoped you were when I saw you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl flushed faintly at this, but her embarrassment
was covered by Julie, who gave a desperate choking cough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here!” said her husband gravely. “Take another pastille,
Julie,” and he drew a box from his pocket. “It’s that
kid of ours,” he explained. “Given her whooping-cough—not
a doubt of it. You’ll both have it now, probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the conductor was calling “All Aboard,” and the three
departed hastily, Irene giving Stacey a mannish grip of
the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey waved at them through the window, then stretched
out in his seat and picked up Irene’s book. He laughed
suddenly. It was “Les Chansons de Bilitis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, anyway, an amusing departure, and Stacey felt in
quite a good humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not a prelude to an amusing trip. Stacey wandered
from city to city drearily. Except for being larger,
they were no worse than Vernon; if they had been, they
might have seemed less unbearable. They were merely
empty—one after the other; empty places inhabited by
empty people. New York sickened him. It wallowed in
wealth, dazzled the eyes with it; rugs, imported motor cars,
china, lights, theatres, food, more food,—there was an absorbed
attempt to minister to every demand of the most
exacting body, with, so far as Stacey could see, not a thought
behind it all. The “Follies” were typical—gorgeous color,
selected girls, riot of noise—not a word spoken that could
reach beyond the intelligence of a sub-normal child. Stacey
yawned through the show, to the justifiable annoyance of his
companion, an old college friend, who had paid God knew
what for the tickets. A hundred magazines stared at Stacey
from the subway book-stalls, with a hundred pictures of
sweet American girls on their covers, and who could tell how
many hundred stories of thwarted Bolshevik plots among
the advertisements inside?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey fled to Philadelphia, thence to Baltimore, then up
to Boston. He went to dinners and dances and dinner-dances
in one place and another. Débutantes a little
nakeder and bolder than he remembered them in past years.
Quite in keeping with everything else. The whole country
singing one vast jazz song of praise to the body, sole preoccupation
how to gratify every instinct it possessed. It
was callousness carried further than was credible, since
across the ocean were thousands who, too, were thinking
only about their bodies—perforce, being unable to get sufficient
food and clothes to keep them alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed at it all with bitter aloofness. What could he
do about it? What could any one do about a world like
this? There was a desolate emptiness in his heart that inhibited
even rage. He longed for annihilation, the absolute
eternal extinction of self. He had certainly altered in these
last months. Even he, who tried not to think of himself,
could not help perceiving this. His reactions were more
jerky, disconnected with any former reactions, incoherent.
He was not a strong scornful soul, detached and looking at
everything in one manner; he was a series of sterile unrelated
emotions, with the only continuous theme that ran
through them all, disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave it up at last and returned to Vernon—why, he
could not have explained. He wrote no one that he was
coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a morning in early December when he got back.
Snow was thick on the city. The taxi that Stacey hired
splashed through slush in the centre of town and slewed
madly, despite its chains, on the boulevard leading to the
Carroll house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey flung himself on the couch in his study and presently
fell asleep. He did not wake until Parker knocked at
the door to call him to luncheon. Two hours of unconsciousness.
Well, that was so much gained, anyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spent as many hours of the afternoon as he could in
bathing and dressing, then at last left the house and tramped
away through the snow. He had no objective in mind, but
after a while, finding himself near Philip Blair’s house, went
up the steps to it and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine opened the door. At first he thought that she
looked wan and tired; but she smiled with pleasure at sight
of him, and the impression vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m awfully glad you’re back, Stacey,” she said. “Phil
was saying last night that it seemed years you’d been away.
Come in. Marian—Mrs. Price—is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt the faintest touch of surprise,—no more, for he
was almost done with correlating facts. His mind no longer
worked that way. He was rapidly growing unable to see
people in relation to one another, and so to find one relation
natural, another curious. Unity was beginning to desert
his impressions. Each of them seemed to come separately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he was scarcely at all surprised when, at sight of
Marian, whom he had nearly forgotten, his old passion for
her leaped up like sudden flame. He shook her hand, with
a word or two of casual greeting, but his eyes met hers
electrically. He made no effort to combat the sensation. If
anything, he was grateful for it. And the antagonism, as
strong as the attraction, that formerly she had aroused in
him, was absent, since he was living in the isolated moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian was lovely, he thought, sick with an unrecognized
desire for loveliness. She wore a toque of white fur that
fitted close to her small head, and there were white furs
over her shoulders. She was a little thinner than before
her marriage, and her delicate features were as clear and
fine as those of a silver goddess on some Syracusan coin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all three sat down and talked, somehow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, where have you been this time, Stacey?” Marian
asked gaily. “Fighting more dragons? Doing dozens of
herculean tasks—Augean stables, hydras, taking Atlas’ place
for a time?” She gave him a malicious smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clearly Marian was as hostile as ever. No matter! On
the contrary, he was instinctively glad of her hostility. It
revealed warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oddly enough, it was Catherine who flushed at it. Stacey
noted the flush with surprise. Oh, well, everything was
odd! There was no use in trying to clear it up. It was
also incomprehensible that, feeling as he was feeling toward
Marian, he should not impatiently desire to have Catherine
go away and leave them together. Yet he desired nothing
of the sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he replied peaceably to Marian, “I’ve merely been
boring myself to extinction in a stupid world. Any time
that Atlas wants to let the sky fall on it he may, so far as
I’m concerned. But,” he added, “it’s gratifying to have
you make all your metaphors Greek, Marian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bit her lip at this, and her eyes shone dangerously
for an instant. But presently she smiled again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey turned to Catherine. “How are all of you?” he
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not very brilliant, I’m afraid,” she said, a trifle wearily.
“We’ve all got colds—all except Carter, who’s still at school
now. I’ve got a cold, Phil’s got a bad cold, and Jackie’s got
a horrid cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old chap! Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upstairs. You can hear him cough regularly every
thirty-two seconds. I timed him last night.” She made a
brave attempt to pass it off lightly. But Stacey perceived
that she was worn out, and felt sorry for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t I go up and sit with him and let you rest?” he
asked. He was quite sincere in the demand, too; which was
as strange as everything else, since his passion for Marian
was bubbling in his veins like a Circean draft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—thank you,” said Catherine, with a rare beautiful
smile. “He’s asleep now. I’ll go up when he wakes. I’m
afraid,” she went on, with involuntary formality, and turning
to Marian, “that I don’t seem very cordial. Really I’m
glad you came—both of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly?” asked Marian prettily. “Then I’ll stay a few
minutes longer. I was afraid I might be tiring you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey considered her. He felt that she was hard beneath
her beauty. She was not pitiful. She was not interested in
sickness. It annoyed her. Yet this judgment made not the
slightest difference in what he was feeling toward her. The
only thing that affected him was his perception that she was
somehow tense, and that she was staying for him. This
stirred him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange trio—even Stacey could feel that; yet they
managed to talk with apparent ease—of Vernon, New York,
the weather,—anything. What a thing training was!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a small pathetic whine came from upstairs. Catherine
rose hastily. “It’s Jackie,” she explained. “You’ll excuse
me for a few minutes, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t we better go?” Marian asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please! I’ll give him his medicine and get him to
sleep again and be back down presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a thing I can do? You’re sure?” Stacey begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, truly, thank you,” Catherine replied, and hurried
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither Stacey nor Marian moved, but their eyes met
instantly. They gazed at each other in silence. Stacey’s
heart beat heavily; he could feel the throb of it chokingly in
his throat. Marian’s eyes were inscrutable, but her lips were
shut closely in an expression of sullen anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he leaned forward. “Marian!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not reply, but her fine nostrils dilated slightly.
There was another moment of silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you happy?” he demanded brusquely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” The monosyllable seemed to spring forth without
her volition. “You know I’m not, Stacey Carroll,” she
added presently, with concentrated bitterness. “Why do
you want to insult me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—don’t!” he replied, a sudden touch of pity softening
his passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were, in some strange, partial, imperfect manner,
made for each other; for they caught each other’s emotions
unerringly. The hostility went out of Marian’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t have believed,” she said, after a moment, “that
any one could be so unbearably stupid as Ames is, hour
after hour, day after day.” Hatred flared up again in her
eyes—but not hatred of Stacey this time, he knew. “And—brutal!”
she added, between her teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey could follow her thoughts as clearly as though they
had been small distorted goblins leaping up and vanishing
in the air. The cult of her body,—Marian had always had
it, refined upon it fastidiously. Not at all vain, she had
been aloofly physically proud. What she had felt for her
own body was precisely what her father felt for his Chinese
vases. And now she had had to turn this one cherished
possession over to a new and despised master. Stacey
caught it all, not through such analysis, but in a swift intuitive
glimpse. He writhed. “It’s all your fault, yours!”
her eyes seemed to say to him. He sprang up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marian!” he cried, and strode across to her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had risen, too, and her arms were about his neck
almost as soon as his own encircled her. She lifted her lips
to his with a long tremulous sigh. A flood of passion submerged
them. When he released her she tottered, shaking,
and clung to the back of the chair. He had never seen her
so moved—he could think this even while his own heart
bounded. Her face was glowing, transfigured and beautiful—oh,
beautiful!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ames—will not—be—home—to-night!” she stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, dizzily, holding her hands so tight that he
must have hurt them cruelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was reckless. Nothing, not the faintest bond, held
him back. He wanted Marian and would have her. As for
Ames’s absence from home, it was negligible. He did not
care a rap that Ames was away, either on his own account
or because of Marian’s reputation; or for any other reason.
He would follow this instinct, this desire. But the truth
about Stacey is deeper. He would now have followed
equally any desire—a desire to commit murder, for example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed at the girl, then slowly drew her to him again,
but more gently this time, till his cheek pressed her hot cheek
and his nostrils inhaled the fragrance of her curly hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Stacey, if—if Catherine—were to come in!” she
murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that moment Catherine did come in. She started.
Her hand went to her heart. Then she stood there in the
doorway, silent, motionless, not accusing, only like a somber
intruder on a tragedy. It is astounding, but the truth, that
even at such a moment Stacey could receive from Catherine
an impression of something fate-like, goddess-like, more
than human, a sense of bigness. Again the unrelated character
of his impressions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Marian, who had torn herself away from Stacey,
gasped, then gave a little hysterical laugh, and fled from the
house without a word, gathering her trailing white fur
swiftly about her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was unmoved, except in the way the subsiding sea
is moved when a storm is past. He stood looking squarely
at Catherine, a twisted ironical smile on his lips, his eyes
cool and challenging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he said finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine sank down in the chair where Marian had sat,
and leaned forward, folding her hands above her knees.
Her dark eyes did not leave his. He saw that for the first
time in their relationship all shyness had slipped from her.
There was something magnificent about her, he thought,
now that he really saw her unveiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Stacey, don’t! don’t!” she said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” he asked, with polite detachment. “Sanctity
of the marriage relation?” She shook her head. “What
then? Moral discipline of self-denial? Regard for Ames
Price—Vernon’s third-best golf player? Or concern for
Marian? You needn’t worry about Marian. She’ll never
feel remorse, and no more shall I. Come, Catherine, you’re
not communicative!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you know I can’t talk readily,” she said. “But, oh,
Stacey, don’t! please don’t! I’m not speaking to you with
reasons—only from my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he returned grimly, “you’re speaking with all the
massed tradition heaped up under the impression that
through it some purpose can be followed. All a mistake, I
tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!” she cried, her grave face alight with expression.
“I’m not!” Suddenly her eyes grew pitiful. “Oh,
Stacey,” she said, “you poor hurt child! Do you want to
hurt yourself more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this his calm was shaken. A dull resentment stirred
in him,—but not because he was vain, or even proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” he said slowly, “that because I—some one
else that I used to be—felt in such and such a way about
Marian, you would not have me trample on those old illusions,
for fear of pain. Catherine, I do not give <span class='it'>that</span> for
my illusions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nor I, either, Stacey! ‘Don’t’ is all I can say. In
your heart you know I’m right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not!” he burst out. He was angry now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she nodded her head. “You do,” she repeated. “Ah,
dear Stacey, think! You’re hard and bitter—or you think
you are—really you’re only hurt”—(he winced)—“but the
one impulse you have is to look at things squarely, and to
be one who can look at them so. Will you, then, do—do—crooked
things, have a secret back-stairs liaison, hide behind—corners,
meet Marian in the dark, with whispers?
Oh, you mustn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thrust went deep. He walked up and down the room
restlessly, his heart full of anger and pain. Finally he
turned on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do what I please!” he cried. “Who are you to preach
to me like this? What are you in my life? Nothing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this she started, then buried her head in her hands
and wept. And when he saw that he had hurt her, as he had
intended, he was shocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, she lifted her head, unashamed, almost at once.
“Forgive me!” she said simply. “Who am I? Who are
we? We—Phil and I—love you. That’s the only power we
have over you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed at her for a moment, helplessly and remorsefully.
“I’ll do as you say,” he said dully. But, with his
surrender, anger rushed upon him again furiously. “Only,”
he added, trembling with rage, “I’ll tell you that you and
Phil are impossible! You’re too good! Abominably good!
It’s sickening! Leave me alone now, both of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snatched up his hat and coat and hurried out of
the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey plunged blindly down the hill, in an insane fury of
rage and thwarted passion. His mind was a hot swirling
confusion which he made no attempt to clarify. But in the
welter two things remained firm—his will to go to Marian’s
house to-night, his will not to go. These were two equal
warring forces. Their conflict churned up anger—anger
with Catherine, anger with himself for having inexplicably
yielded to Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under foot were wet snow and ice. Stacey slipped again
and again. But he tore on, as though there were some
definite place he must get to, though, indeed, had he been
capable of reflection, he would have perceived the reverse
to be true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached the boulevard and turned into it, ploughing
along at a tremendous pace in the direction of his home.
But presently some small capacity for thought did return to
him, and he became aware that he most certainly did not
want to go home. He began to walk less rapidly, and at
last stopped altogether, bewildered, and looked about him,
not knowing what to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only five o’clock, but the early winter dusk was
already darkening the air, and lights were beginning to shine
out in the windows of houses. Stacey stood beneath one of
the brilliant clusters of electric globes with which the city
government had adorned the boulevard, and stared in front
of him. But he was not really reflecting; his mind was
simply at a deadlock between the two opposing forces that
usurped it. Some new factor, however slight, must intervene
before he could act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The factor revealed itself externally as a high-powered
racing car, which drew up, throbbing, at the curb, with a
grinding of suddenly applied brakes and a spatter of slush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Carroll!” called the young man who was driving
it. “Pretty nasty under foot. Can I give you a lift?” He
reached over and flung open the door of the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey looked up, with a start. His mind cleared swiftly.
The pause before he was able to reply was hardly perceptible.
“Oh, hello, Whittaker!” he said, in quite a natural
voice. “Thanks.” He rested one foot on the step of the car
and frowned. “The only thing is that I don’t know where I
want to go. I was just trying to make up my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man at the wheel laughed. He was a big
fellow, appearing still bigger because of the enormous fur
coat he wore, and had a ruddy face, with pleasant eyes and
a hard mouth. He looked like a commercial traveller come
into a fortune. “Well,” he said, “that does make it a bit
difficult, don’t it? Anyhow, hop in! You certainly don’t
want to stick around where you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey obeyed, slamming the door after him, and sat down
beside Whittaker, who started the car off slowly along
the boulevard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man was of the type known in current slang
as “hard boiled.” This quality, however, was not the result
of his service in France—he had been a lieutenant of infantry
in a different division from Stacey’s. The war had
not had the slightest effect on Whittaker. He had always
been “hard boiled,” even before the term existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to go home,” Stacey explained. “Fed up
with home. Where you going? Can’t you take me along?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other laughed again. “Sure! I <span class='it'>can</span>, but you wouldn’t
go. Too much of a high-minded puritan. Why, you
wouldn’t even end up that dinner we had in Paris in any
decent way! I’m going out to Bell’s at Clarefield for the
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Stacey, “so will I, if you’ll take me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, the sky has fallen! My last illusion’s gone!
War, thy name is corruption!” Whittaker exclaimed.
“Sure! Glad to have you!” he added genially. “Now let’s
figure it out. I’ve got a little girl I’m going to take along.
We can squeeze you in all right—all the cosier, what? But
you’d better go and dig up some one yourself and get
<span class='it'>your</span> car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey shook his head. “No, I’ll ride with you—if I
won’t be butting in. Maybe I’ll find some one out there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” the other returned dubiously. “But everybody
will be pretty much paired off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drive around to my house and we’ll have a drink while
I get a few things together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.” The car leaped forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Stacey’s mind the will to have Marian, the will not to
have her, and the anger persisted, but underneath. Above,
as the active part, was the matter of this trivial escapade.
His dissent from Whittaker’s suggestion that he get his own
car and bring another young lady was not due to distaste—nothing
so fastidious as that could get a hearing now—but
to Stacey’s positive fear of being left alone. If he were left
to himself, nothing, as night fell and his longing deepened,
could prevent his going to Marian. He must <span class='it'>be</span> prevented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker,” he said to the man who took Whittaker’s snowy
fur coat in the hall, “I’m going away again for a day or
two. You’ll tell Mr. Carroll when he gets in. First, please
get us some whiskey and a siphon—Scotch, Whittaker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then kindly pack that very small bag of mine with
things for the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Parker had brought the drinks to the library he
came up close to Stacey. “Excuse me, sir,” he said in a low
tone. “There’s a young lady who’s called to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey opened his eyes wide, but he rose immediately.
“Just a minute, Whittaker,” he remarked. “Be back at
once. Pour yourself a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?” he asked Parker, when they were in
the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked perturbed. “She wouldn’t give me her
name, sir, and that’s why I thought I’d better speak to
you quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did perfectly right. Where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the little drawing-room, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most likely a book agent,” said Stacey, and walked down
the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not a book agent. It was Irene Loeffler. She
stood waiting, an expression of mingled fear and determination
on her face, across which the color came and went
oddly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” said Stacey brusquely. “What are you doing
here?” He did not offer to shake hands; nor did she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at him. She swallowed nervously. He
could see the movement of her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll—tell you,” she replied desperately. “I came to see—you,
because you won’t come to see me. I—I don’t believe
in silly old conventions. You—you’d come to me if you—were
fond-of-me” (she blurted out the three words in one
terrified syllable), “so I—come to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any one half-way normal would have laughed outright.
Irene was so absurdly out of harmony with her speech. She
was as shrinking and virginal as her words were shameless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey was beyond humor. He was living in a state
of nervous exasperation bordering on madness. “Oh, I
see!” he said icily. “A declaration!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face flamed. “You can be insulting if you want to!”
she cried, with a sudden angry sincerity. Then she went on
with her speech. “And when I came and—asked for you,
your man—told me you were just—going away again—in a
few minutes. And I thought—that is, I decided—I mean,
take me with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her in amazement and for an instant did feel
a small flicker of amusement. The young woman’s polite
offer chimed in so well with Whittaker’s suggestion that
they needed another girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very kind of you,” he said coolly, “but I don’t
think you’d like the place. I’m going out to Bell’s Tavern at
Clarefield. It’s a bit rough there and not well thought of in
Vernon society. Greatly as I should enjoy your companionship,
I fear you’d find yourself rather disapproved of in
the best Bolshevik circles on your return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She winced under his words and flushed crimson, but she
faced him, not unheroically. “You’re hateful!” she cried.
“But I—I’ll go—if you’ll take me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the exasperation that he was feeling within him burst
loose suddenly upon poor Irene, who had nothing to do
with causing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little fool!” Stacey said savagely, “even the idiots
in your club have got more sense than you! They don’t
know anything about facts, and you don’t, either. But they
know enough to let them alone. You go home and play with
your theories and don’t mix them up with facts any more.
If I had so much as a shadow of a fancy for you I’d take
you with me. But I haven’t—luckily for you! I don’t care
two beans about you! Now run along home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, with the air of his mind cleared by this explosion,
and when he saw how the girl had collapsed under his brutality,
he felt suddenly sorry for her, and sick and tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Irene!” he said, taking her arm. “I didn’t
mean all that. Only, honestly, you don’t care anything for
me. You’ve just built up an imaginary me and lavish an
imaginary love on him. Forgive me for being so rough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What he said this time was true beyond a doubt, though
Irene could hardly be expected to believe it. For when he
took her arm she did not draw close to him in delight; she
shrank instinctively from his touch. She was sobbing, but
he was probably quite right in thinking that it was from
anger and shame. She controlled herself presently and
wiped her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I’ll be going,” she remarked, in a strangled
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the door with her. “Good night, Irene,” he
said cordially, shaking her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’m sorry to have—put you out,” she said absurdly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right!” he replied, with a touch of amusement.
“Good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey returned to Whittaker. “Sorry to keep you so
long,” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No harm in that,” the other returned genially, “so long
as you leave me in such good company.” He waved his
hand toward the carafe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, good stuff, isn’t it?” said Stacey, and took a stiff
drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set off presently, Stacey giving a sigh of relief at
being out of the house and in some one else’s hands—no
longer obliged to think for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite dark now. The car ploughed through the
freezing slush and mud of a suburban district until at last
it drew up before a small outlying drug-store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whittaker blew the horn, and a girl scurried out into the
green and purple light, and down to the curb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee!” she exclaimed, “there’s two of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh,” Whittaker assented. “My friend, Stacey
Carroll, Minnie. Another hero of the late world unpleasantness.
Minnie Prentice, Carroll. Hop in, Minnie, old
thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had stepped down to let the girl in. She shook his
hand and turned her small piquant face to his for a moment,
then sprang up lightly, dropping a kiss on Whittaker’s
cheek, running her arm through his, and snuggling into
place, all in a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie,” Whittaker remarked, as the car leaped forward,
“was lately a prominent, if silent, member of that
unfortunate production, ‘The Pearl Girl,’ which expensive
show completely failed to arouse Chicago from its sleep,
and passed away, with me finally almost the only mourner.
Disgusted with the rouge and corruption of the stage, Minnie
decided to reform; and where, as I explained to her,
can you reform better than in Vernon? in which pleasant
city she now holds a position at Leveredge’s department store
(notion counter), and has me for a chaperon. Hey,
Minnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget to tell Mr. What’s-his-name the rest, Bill,”
said Minnie with dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Carroll, sweetness, Carroll! The Vernon Carrolls!
So I do,” Whittaker rattled on, meanwhile driving the car
consummately over a slippery expanse of ice. “Having a
sweet pure voice, Minnie is on the very verge of being admitted
to the First Presbyterian Church choir. Hence the
obscure situation of our meeting-place. For, strange as it
may seem, the First Presbyterian Church would not approve
of my respectful appreciation of Minnie. Evil minds church
people have!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman giggled. “My, but you’re silly, Bill!
I’ll say you are!” she observed. “What’ll Mr.—er—Carroll—got
it that time, didn’t I?—think of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t you worry about that!” Whittaker replied.
“He won’t think of you at all. He’s got a secret sorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl turned her face toward Stacey. “That so, Mr.
Carroll? You got a secret sorrow?” she inquired. “What’s
she like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. He was not diverted by such patter, but
he was soothed by it; it was precisely what he needed to
tide him over these hours. “Blonde,” he returned. “As
blonde as you are. At least, as blonde as I think you are
from your voice. From what I’ve seen of you so far your
coloring appeared to be mixed green and purple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, sweetness!” Whittaker urged. “Coax the
little mind along! Teach it to walk! Don’t be afraid, little
pet! Toddle over to daddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” exclaimed the girl, “I get you! The lights there at
that drug-store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it! That’s it! Why, the little darling took three
whole steps by its own self!” Whittaker said admiringly.
“Colossal mind Minnie has!” he added to Stacey. “Too big
to work! Too big to move! Just lies still and pants!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you shut your face, Bill! I guess my mind’s as good
as yours any time. You care a lot about it, anyway, like hell
you do! I’ll tell you what you care about.” And she whispered,
giggling, into his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With such trivial talk they passed the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But presently the car swung into a wide road, where the
snow, well packed and sanded, had not been torn into icy
slush by city drays; and here Whittaker increased the speed.
The hum of the engine became a smooth rhythmic thunder,
the cleft air roared past, and any further talk was impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was thrown back on his thoughts. They became
the reality, the actual present only a shadow. He was but
vaguely conscious of his surroundings—the cold flowing air,
the car’s headlights on the snow, Whittaker, the girl’s warm
body next him. The memory of Marian was more vivid
than all these things. Soon now she would be expecting
him at her house, and he would not be there. He writhed.
And what would she think of him? She must hate him.
Until to-day he had not cared what she felt toward him.
But now it was different. He and she had been honest with
each other to-day. Fancies gone, illusions gone, everything
false and pretty stripped off, their two small remaining selves
had met for the first time in harmony, each no longer asking
anything that the other could not give, but demanding the
possible fiercely. He had no right to break off in this way.
So Stacey thought dizzily, anger with Catherine and himself
returning at intervals, as a variation on the theme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came back wearily to the present, as the lights of
Clarefield flashed up and the car swept over the curved
driveway leading to the gleaming road-house. He stepped,
shivering with cold, from the car, and helped the girl out.
They waited on the hotel verandah while Whittaker drove
the car back to the garage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H-how about-t it now, Mr. C-Carroll?” she demanded
gaily, her teeth chattering. “Am I still p-purple and green?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He forced as much interest as he could, and looked her
over. “No,” he answered, “you’re—well, no matter! Only
I shouldn’t worry about a mind, if I were you. You don’t
need one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She really was pretty, he saw with indifference. Bad
mouth, though, he noted, with an equal lack of interest.
Loose and stupid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl returned his scrutiny. “You’re not so worse,
either,” she said, considering him with sophisticated
sensual eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whittaker returned. “God! but it’s cold! Let’s run for
drinks. Thank the Lord, the bar here is still wide open!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went in. A large room on the right was already half
full of people dining and dancing. Whittaker paused for a
moment to reserve a table, then the three hurried off to the
bar. It occurred to Stacey that he had better slip away from
Minnie and Whittaker after a little. He had no right to
spoil their evening. Nice sort of companion they must be
finding him! But Whittaker, with the geniality of his sort,
seemed to find no fault in his guest, while, as for Minnie,
she would clearly be benevolently uncritical of any man
under forty, not bad looking, who would drink. Moreover,
something soon happened to make Stacey change his
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glancing across the room to another alcoved space opposite,
he caught sight, over a woman’s shoulder, of a face he
thought he recognized, started, half rose to make sure, then
sank down again in his chair and burst into unforced
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the joke, Carroll?” Whittaker inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing—except that I—see Ames Price is here,” Stacey
returned weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, is he really?” exclaimed Whittaker. “Well, I say,
it is a bit soon, isn’t it?” And he, too, rose to look, and
laughed, though the real joke was lost on him. “Stewed,
too! Stewed to the gills!” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey got up. “Excuse me a minute,” he said. “I’ll go
over and worry him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey crossed the room slowly. His mouth still
twitched with amusement, but the expression thus given
his face was malignant rather than mirthful. No, he was
certainly not at his best when he smiled. He paused near
the alcoved recess and stood gazing maliciously at Ames
Price, whose back was toward him, and at the tall handsome
young woman sitting across the table from Ames. She was
slender and dark, with large eyes and a rather fine, weary
mouth. She looked bored by her escort, and returned
Stacey’s stare with cool interest. Then he touched Ames on
the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked around slowly, but when he saw Stacey
his mouth fell open, a slow flush spread over his smooth
face and bald forehead, an apprehensive look came into his
eyes, and he rose quickly, swaying a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say! What-ta you doing here, Shtacey?” he demanded
thickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me?” Stacey returned. “Why shouldn’t I be here? I’m
a free man, unbound, no ties at all, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Price clung to his arm and pulled him away to the edge
of another booth, out of hearing of the young woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Sh’unfortunate!” he said hoarsely, struggling with his
intoxication. “I mean to shay—<span class='it'>say</span>—you of all people!”
He drew out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead. “Look
here, Shta—no, Carroll—you don’t mind if I call you
Carroll? ’S’ easier to say than Shta—your other name.
No lack of inti—intima—cy intended. Look here, Carroll!
Now I’m drunk, of course! You can see that!
Anybody can see that! Whole world can see that!
Hell! that isn’t what I was trying to say.” He paused
again, made an even greater effort at self-mastery,
and really did achieve some moderate success. The
expression of concern in his glazed eyes deepened. “Damn
it all! You wonder what I’m doing here! Now
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no,” said Stacey, enjoying himself evilly. “I saw
you here and just dropped over to say hello.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ames reached for a carafe that stood among glasses on a
table near-by, poured a tumblerful of water with a shaking
hand, and drank. Then he shook his head solemnly. “No,
you wonder. Of course you wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey watched him critically. “Doing pretty well,” he
thought. But beneath Stacey’s surface calm was hatred.
So this—this sweating, panting, bald-headed animal—owned
Marian, did he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it all, Stacey!” Ames whispered raucously, leaning
close to his tormentor, “I can’t help it! Marian’s so God-damned
cold! ’S’no place to talk about her—I’ve got sense
enough left to know that. But got to explain myself to you—you
of all people! Cold, that’s what she is,—ice!
Freezes a man. Honest to God she does! Looks-a fellow
’s’though he was dirt—yes, tha’s it, dirt! Locks her door.
’S’why I come here. Let her treat me like a man—I’d be
best of husbands—none better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to hear this,” Stacey returned smoothly. “Wished
you both all sorts of happiness. But you don’t owe me any
explanations. Besides, this is a place for light-hearted
gaiety. Shame to spoil it with dull thoughts of home. I’m
out here with Bill Whittaker and his young lady. Thought
perhaps, when I saw you, we might all arrange to dine
together in one large genial party. How about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ames stared at him, his face clearing slowly. “Why,
sure!” he said at last, heaving a sigh. “Thought at first
you’d—oh, never mind now! what? Come on over and
meet Ethel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to. Not cold, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not cold. Not warm <span class='it'>or</span> cold,” said Ames judicially,
“but friendly. Good sort, Ethel!” He drew Stacey back to
the alcove. “Ethel, ’s Stacey Carroll. Wants us to dine with
him an’ some other people. First-rate, what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey bowed, and the girl looked at him appraisingly.
She was really very handsome, he saw now, with an enigmatic
quality in her face, caused perhaps by the fact that her
black eyes were not quite horizontal, but slanted down ever
so faintly toward the bridge of her nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said finally, in a pleasant voice, “that’ll
be nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll tell you,” Stacey remarked. “I’ll go back and
arrange with Whittaker about it. See you both in a few
minutes.” And he crossed the room, smiling again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful plan I’ve evolved, Whittaker,” he said, sitting
down and sipping the cocktail that was waiting for him.
“Ames is drunk, as you observed. Got over it a bit in talking
with me, but will grow drunker presently. Very attractive
girl with him—name of Ethel. I feel innocent sorrow
for her. D’you mind if we all dine together? I propose to
remove Ethel gently from Ames. Told you I’d find some
one out here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whittaker laughed. “Sure!” he said heartily. “That’s
something like! We’ll help all we can, hey, Minnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee! Mr. Carroll, and I thought you was slow!” the girl
exclaimed delightedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Minnie,” said Stacey, “of course you’ll find me
slow. Here I am, Bill’s guest. I owe it to him to suppress
all the evil desires you arouse in me. Besides, we’re Presbyterians
in our family, have a pew in the church. I’d
never feel the same again towards the choir if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He
finished his cocktail and gazed at her reproachfully over the
glass, while she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all three crossed the room to Ames, who presented
them heavily to Ethel. He was no drunker than before, however,—perhaps
even a little less drunk, and he entered the
dining-room with dignified concentrated steadiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The table the head-waiter had reserved for Whittaker
would only seat four comfortably. “I’m the outsider. I’ll
sit here at the corner,” Stacey said firmly, and motioned the
waiter to draw him up a chair close to Ethel’s. “You order,
Whittaker, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was pandemonium, on account of the jazz band
that was at one end and the cabaret performance that was
everywhere. All conversations were necessarily shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It occurred to Stacey that the age he lived in was devoted
to noise, as a barbaric preventive of thought. No doubt it
was right. What good had thought ever done the world?
Here were the five of them, come out frankly in quest of
food, drink, lights, noise, and sexual gratification. Nothing
but animals, all five! Well, what of it? Clearly that was
what the earth’s millions were all, in this glaring after-war
illumination, revealed as seeking. The only difference
among them was that some were more complicated and
refined in their animalism than others. There wasn’t much
complexity out here. So much the better! Strip off the last
silken shreds of decoration! Leave the truth stark naked!
The animal was all there was, and there was only so much,
and no more, to the animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Stacey mused, under cover of the hubbub, not perceiving
that the fact of his musing denied its conclusion;
not remarking that his own word was “quest”; not seeing
that people were trying to be, and thus were not wholly,
animals; certainly not seeing that this quest was as futile
as any other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How, indeed, could his thoughts fail to be superficial?
They swam languidly on the surface waters of his mind.
Beneath was a painful turmoil into which he struggled not
to look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He roused himself sharply, with a start, and looked
around. Whittaker, on his right, was leaning over to Minnie
just beyond, his face close to hers, his hand beneath the
table. She was answering his glance and his words, her blue
eyes dilated below the delicately darkened eyebrows, her
loose mouth babbling or, between speeches, drooping
sensually. Ames Price was concerned with nothing but
the effort to control his intoxication. Stacey turned to the
girl beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her pose was easy and graceful, and the curve of her
cheek beneath the mass of her black hair was rather fine.
Stacey felt the enigmatic quality about her even now when
he could not see her slanting eyes. His knee touched hers,
not intentionally but because they were sitting very close
together, and she turned her face slowly toward his. Their
eyes met. Hers were extraordinarily large and dark, and
gazed into his, half curiously, half cynically, for a long
moment. Strange eyes, unfathomable! Suddenly dull fire
smoldered in them, and Stacey felt dizzy. He shivered,—but
so did she; he felt her knee tremble against his. She
smiled and lowered her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard of you, Mr. Carroll,” she observed calmly.
“Every one in Vernon has, of course. I’d rather like to have
been a man and fought as you’ve fought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clearly she had better self-control than he. He paused
before replying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you, now?” he said then. “That’s odd! You
look too properly disdainful to care about fighting, and, as
to being a man, you seem to me very thoroughly a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him again, squarely, appearing to study him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” he added abruptly, “what’s your name?
Your drunken friend presented you merely as Ethel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wyatt. Ethel Wyatt. It wouldn’t mean anything to
you. But I prefer Ames drunk, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to Price. “Cheer up, Ames, old top!” she
cried, in a jovial, quite different voice. “Cocktails! Here’s
to you!” And she pushed his glass toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ames gave her a dazed smile, patted her hand heavily,
and drank. “ ’S’a mistake!” he said. “Had one a minute
ago. Oughtn’t to have any more. But mus’ drink with
Essel—Ethel.” He beamed across at Stacey. “Told you so,
Carroll. See her for yourself now. Friendly. Not warm
<span class='it'>or</span> cold, but friendly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she turned to Stacey. “You believe him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” He stared at her fiercely. “Will you chuck Ames
and run off somewhere with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, later,” she replied coolly, “when he’s quite drunk.
I don’t want a scene. I hate scenes.” And she turned back
to Ames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the whole dinner she paid no more attention
to Stacey, talking instead, with smiles and a coarsened voice,
to her escort. But, beneath the table, her ankle was curved
about Stacey’s, and now and again he felt it tremble, and
trembled, too. But no touch of emotion was in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had begun this merely as a savage joke on Ames. He
was physically stirred now and going on with it eagerly, in
search of oblivion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while, Ethel being in sprightly conversation with
Ames, Whittaker leaned close to Stacey. “I say! what’s the
matter?” he demanded. “Wake up and get busy, Carroll!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Stacey calmly, “that’s all right! It’s all arranged.
We’re only waiting for Ames to get completely
blind. Miss Wyatt doesn’t want a scene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whittaker stared, then laughed. “My heartiest apologies!”
he exclaimed. “You’re a cool pair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I going to go from here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Whittaker thoughtfully, “you might go on
to West Boyd. Fifteen miles straight down the road.
There’s a good inn there, the Thorndike. Oh, but hang it,
you haven’t got a car!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t I rent one here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whittaker shook his head. “Take mine, old chap!” he
said generously. “I don’t need it. I’ll telephone my man to
bring out the other to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! Sure! Go ahead! I’m all for helping young
lovers. Need money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ve got my check-book. I suppose they’ll cash a
check here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whittaker nodded. “I’ll endorse it. They know me.”
He laughed again. “What a lark!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Stacey suddenly, “one thing! Keep Minnie
quiet! Don’t want to let Ethel know I had this planned
before I met her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long Ames rose, staggering, his face livid.
“ ’Scuse me,” he said thickly, “jus’ minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s going to be sick, I guess,” said Minnie delightedly,
watching him lurch across the crowded room toward the
door. “But, gee! Mr. Carroll, you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whittaker cut her off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey scribbled a check, and Ethel drank her coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t be back, I think,” she observed calmly. “Not
for a long time. They’ll find him on some floor after a
while. So .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She turned to Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we’ll leave you,” he concluded for her. “Thanks
awfully for the car, Whittaker. And remember what the
dinner check comes to. I’ll split it with you later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>will</span> not! My surprise and joy at your behavior are
reward enough. Come on! We’ll see you off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently, when Ethel had put on her wraps, and the
car had been brought around, and the two suitcases put in,
Whittaker and Minnie stood on the verandah to see the
lovers depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I knew where Ames was I’d get his shoe and throw
after you,” called Whittaker, as Stacey started the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no sign of Ames.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The chill silent night was a relief to Stacey, and perhaps to
the girl, after the heated promiscuity of the road-house. An
aloof wintry moon shone coldly on the white fields and made
the frozen ponds glitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey and Ethel might have been husband and wife from
their nonchalant indifference to conversation. They hardly
spoke on the long ride; yet there was no constraint between
them. Once he asked her if she was cold, and she said that
she was not; and once she observed that there was a bad
grade a little way ahead, and he noted idly to himself the
absence of self-consciousness with which she admitted to
knowing the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” he remarked, in a matter-of-fact tone, as
they drew near West Boyd, “that I’d better register us as
man and wife under some fancy name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl turned her head toward him slowly. “For my
sake or your own?” she inquired coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For neither. To save the hotel’s face and avoid annoyance
for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded, as though satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She entered the inn unconcernedly, except that she
wrinkled her forehead and half closed her strange eyes in
the sudden brightness, and she stood with equal unconcern
by Stacey’s side while he registered and asked for a room.
Yet even he, who was hardly at all curious about her, recognized
that her calm was not the mere callousness of the
prostitute. It was easy, not hard, and so it seemed to arise
not from outer experience—however much experience she
might have had—but from an inner indifference to facts.
So, at any rate, Stacey thought; then thought no more
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a bell-boy had accompanied them to their room and
set down their bags and departed, closing the door upon
them, she slipped out of her heavy coat and removed her
hat gracefully. But then, at last, she turned slowly to
Stacey, who had been standing, watching her. Still in
silence, they gazed into each other’s eyes profoundly, as
they had, two hours earlier, at dinner. The girl’s mouth
trembled. Suddenly they kissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you’re—brutal!” she stammered, much later, panting,
her face convulsed in a savage ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—and you?”</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>They remained at the inn for five days. But though
physically their relation was unrestrained, entire, frenzied,
no faintest intimacy of any other kind grew up between
them, unless it may be counted as intimacy that they were
perfectly at ease with each other in their hours of bodily
calm, and could walk together across the frozen fields,
silent or nearly so, unembarrassed, each thinking his own
thoughts. Ethel might almost swoon in Stacey’s embrace;
a moment after, her dark eyes, that had been moist and
dilated, would become as unfathomable as ever. And, as
for him, he might, and did, serve passion recklessly until
pleasure turned to pain; nothing would come of it all, nothing
be left over, no emotion, not even a grateful memory of
delight, not even disgust,—only emptiness. Never in soft
moments of assuagement did tenderness start up in him or
show in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked, of course. And they did not say sharp
things or get on one another’s nerves. They were not
enemies. They talked only of general subjects, dispassionately,
objectively. Or, rather, all subjects, even ideas, became
external when Stacey and Ethel spoke of them. Yet
the girl talked well and intelligently. It was simply that she
revealed no emotional interest in anything they discussed.
She seemed as detached and indifferent as he. But this,
though it made their association comfortable, was not a bond
between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once did their two personalities become conscious of
each other and touch and draw a spark. When this happened
it was immediately apparent that, though Ethel and
Stacey were not enemies, they were antagonists, facing one
another warily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the last morning of their stay. The girl was
lying motionless on the bed, in the pose of Manet’s
“Olympe” and with much the same exotic appearance.
Stacey was sprawling in a chintz-covered rocker. He was
suffering from a kind of bleak despair; for he was reflecting
that everything he had done was impotent to destroy his
desire for Marian. This was unfair, he thought sullenly,
since his desire for Marian, too, was purely physical. Why,
then, should not this liaison suffice? So, when Ethel spoke
to him he answered her curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it time,” she observed, without moving, “that you
asked me about my past life, how I reached this regrettable
condition, <span class='it'>and</span> so forth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up slowly and considered her. “No,” he said,
“I’m not interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her eyebrows. “Dear me! Not at all?
How disrespectful of conventions! Why? Because you
despise me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I don’t despise you,” he replied indifferently.
“Moreover, you don’t care whether I do or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled a little at this. “I don’t think that in all these
five days I’ve expressed any appreciation of you,” she went
on coolly. “You’re really very satisfactory. Now that’s what
marriage ought to be like. Two healthy animals taking all
the sharp pleasure they can from one another and letting
each other’s immortal souls alone. Silly that they should be
immortal, isn’t it? Perhaps they’re not. I think they must
be, though; they’re so completely solitary. Nobody can ever
have made them, they’re so solitary. They must always
have been,—like stars in the empty sky; and so they must
always go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt interest now at last. She <span class='it'>was</span> strange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was with the Colin Jeffries’ until recently,” she went
on, in the same cool tone and not even troubling to explain
her revelation. Indeed, it was not like a personal revelation.
She seemed to Stacey to be merely meditating aloud—and
about a third person. “With the Colin Jeffries’—as
governess to their children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An impossible house,” she continued imperturbably.
“Mrs. Jeffries is the kind of woman who wants to dig into
every one’s mind and pull out the weeds and plant it with
proper vegetables—cabbages and such—in rows. And Mr.
Jeffries is tiresomely lecherous. He was always trying to
get into my bedroom. Once he hid in my bath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “I didn’t know that, of course,” he said,
“but I might have guessed it. Any such public institution
as Colin Jeffries must have to take it out privately somehow.
I can see why you went away. Still I think you might have
found something a little better than Ames Price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she explained simply, “I didn’t take him on at once.
I had an idea that there might be something more interesting
in a disorderly life than an orderly one. Silly, wasn’t it?
One’s as dull as the other. Ames is really as good a solution
as any. He is generous with money and unperturbing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey frowned. “That reminds me,” he said. “We’ll
have to go back to-day. I’m about at the end of my money
and I have almost none in the bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She expressed no surprise at this, even by a look, though
she must have known that he was supposed to be rich. But
a shadow of regret did cross her face. She gazed at him,
and he at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here!” she said finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obeyed. His eyes caressed her slim form somberly.
“Your body is as strange as your face!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shivered, set her teeth, and stared at him in a fury
of desire.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>They left the inn early on the afternoon of that day and
drove back over the road that led to Clarefield and Vernon.
They were as separate as ever mentally, but they talked
rather more freely, and Stacey, though he felt neither love
nor friendship for the girl, felt esteem for her because she
existed proudly by herself. He would not have her bruised.
He would defend her in a matter-of-fact way from trouble,
as one might defend a stranger from physical attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So: “What are you going to do,” he demanded suddenly,
“when you get back to Vernon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to my apartment,” she returned. “The one Ames
took for me. Ames will come back.” She smiled faintly.
“Are you concerned lest you’ve ruined my prospects?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course,” he said unemotionally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How noble of you! Don’t worry. You haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All at once he laughed. “I was thinking what a marvellous
judge of character Ames is,” he observed. “ ‘Not warm
or cold, Ethel, but friendly!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl turned her head and looked at him strangely,
but this time without smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Clarefield they drove up to Bell’s Tavern where their
adventure had begun, intending to warm themselves before
going on. They sat down in the booth where Ethel had sat
with Ames Price on the night of Whittaker’s dinner.
Stacey reflected moodily, while they waited for the drinks
he ordered, that, though nearly a week had passed since that
evening, nothing whatever had happened. He had succeeded
in staying away from Marian, but he wanted her as
much now as he had wanted her then. Five full days of this
affair with Ethel had not added a fraction to what he felt
and was at the beginning of it, or taken a fraction away. If
time were to be set back, the interlude wiped out, and he
were to find himself sitting again with Whittaker and Minnie,
looking across at Ames drunk, nothing would be
changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was awakened from this reverie by the desk-clerk,
who came up and touched his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you Mr. Stacey Carroll, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” said the clerk. “I remember your cashing
a check here last Saturday night. This telegram came for
you two days ago. We didn’t know what to do about it, and
so we just held it, thinking maybe you’d be back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Stacey, taking it. “Can’t imagine who’d
address me here except Whittaker,” he observed to Ethel,
as he tore open the yellow envelope, “and he’d have sent any
message to West Boyd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as he glanced at the telegram, he started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Philip dangerously ill with pneumonia. Come at once.
Catherine</span>,” it read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey pushed back his chair and got up quickly. “We’ll
have to go—at once!” he said. “A friend of mine is ill—pneumonia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose. “Your face is pale,” she observed, as he
reached for her coat, “You really do care about something,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, holding out the coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to be glad,” she concluded, slipping it on.
“I’m ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink your high-ball first—as quickly as you can,” he
said, not unkindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she returned, “I don’t care about it. Come!
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung money on the table and hurried the girl out.
“And the message is two days old!” he muttered, wondering
dully who could have told Catherine he was at Clarefield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drove the car to Vernon at a tremendous speed, Ethel
sitting silent by his side. He spoke but once, to ask her the
address of her apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they drew up in front of it and he had helped
her out, he stood with her for just a moment on the sidewalk.
For all that he was feeling anxiety for his friend so
strongly as almost to wipe everything else from his mind,
he nevertheless—and even, somehow, because of this—felt
now at last a touch of human interest in Ethel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you ever need anything at all—or want to see me for
any reason, call me up at my house,” he said inadequately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” she murmured. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang back into the car and drove swiftly to Phil’s
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another car standing at the curb. “The doctor’s!”
he thought, with sudden hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey did not ring, but opened the door softly and
walked into the living-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine was sitting there, like some expressionless
Byzantine Madonna, with Carter in her arms. He was
sleeping, his flushed face and tousled yellow hair against her
breast, his legs dangling limply from her lap. There was no
one else in the room. Catherine looked up as Stacey entered,
but she did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her. “Phil?” he demanded in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shadowy expression on her face deepened until it was
unmistakable pain and fatigue, but still she did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead?” Stacey cried hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she replied gently, “he died last night—very
peacefully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey sat down suddenly and turned his head away.
Tears did not come to his eyes, but he gasped, a choking
feeling in his throat that made it hard for him to breathe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Stacey!” said Catherine softly, after a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor me?!” he exclaimed, “oh! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I only got your
telegram an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I knew you couldn’t have got it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey became aware of the sound of feet moving on the
floor above. “Who’s—up there?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s lip trembled. “People doing—the things that
have to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced. “And you’re—left alone here!” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather be. Mrs. Latimer has just gone. She took
Jackie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to go?” he stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat there in silence for a long time. At last the
solemn professional people came down from upstairs and
went out, bowing gravely to Catherine. Then Mrs. Latimer
returned. She looked at Stacey, first in surprise, then
compassionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better go now, Stacey,” Catherine said. “I shall
be all right. Mrs. Latimer and I must put Carter to bed.
Would you like to go up and—look at Phil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “Thanks!” he said, choking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stumbled up the stairs, went into Phil’s room, and
stood there for some time, looking down at the peaceful
emaciated face. Stacey was suffering acute pain and—worse
than that—a deeper sense of desolation than he had
yet felt. He had not dreamed that he cared so much for
Phil. To have shown him so in some way! To have given
something decent and human in return for Phil’s warm
gentleness! The best that Stacey could do for comfort was
to remember that the last time he had seen Phil he had
shaken his hand at parting. Only that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey went downstairs finally and out of the house. He
drove home, then sat down wearily to write a note to Whittaker
thanking him for the car. He gave the note to Parker
and told him to have the chauffeur take it, as soon as possible,
with the car, to Whittaker’s house. He did not feel
irony or bitterness or scorn of himself in doing these things.
They were merely things that had to be done. He was
through with proud hostility of spirit; he was beaten. But
he did not say this to himself, either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father came home before very long. He was gentle
with Stacey, asked him no questions, tried even to veil the
look of apprehensiveness in his own eyes. And Stacey
recognized his kindness, the sweetness of nature that lay
beneath Mr. Carroll’s set firmness,—recognized all his
father’s virtues, more clearly and justly than ever before.
But it was as though he were recognizing the virtues of a
convincing figure in a two-dimensioned movie play. The
world of men had become a world of shadows to Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine alone he felt as a real person—no doubt because
she was suffering the same sorrow as he. He spent
all the time with her that she would permit, and while the
funeral service was being held in the sitting-room of the
little house he sat with her and Carter upstairs in Phil’s old
room. They were both silent, save when they spoke comfortingly
to the frightened weeping boy. They could hear
the grave accents of the clergyman’s voice downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do, Catherine?” he asked her one
morning two or three days later. “Shall you go back to
New York—to your sister’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “No, I’ll stay here for now, I think,”
she replied. “The house rent is paid for a long time ahead,
and I don’t want to take the boys out of school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you need money? You must tell me if you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—thanks,” she answered simply. “I have plenty for
now, and”—her eyes drooped wearily—“Phil carried—quite
heavy insurance. Your father, too, asked me that,” she
added. “He’s been awfully good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would be,” said Stacey drearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine considered him sadly. “Stacey,” she said, “you
look dreadfully ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel a bit fagged,” he admitted. “I’ve been thinking
that towards spring I might go down to father’s place in
North Carolina.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she exclaimed, “yes! But why not go now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said hesitatingly, then paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. You’d like to help me. But there’s nothing you
can do, Stacey. That’s sad, but it’s so. It only—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Gives you an extra worry.” He gazed at her.
“Odd,” he thought, “how strong you are! Stronger than
Phil, stronger than I!” But he only said yes, that he
would go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father greeted the suggestion almost joyfully. “The
best thing possible!” he exclaimed. “There’s the house,
standing empty—hardly been used six months in ten years.
Saddle horse eating his head off in the stable—old Elijah
perishing for want of conversation. I was down there for a
couple of months two years ago, but it bored me. I haven’t
cared for the place since your mother died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded. “I understand how you feel about it,” he
said. And, indeed, he did for a moment receive a sudden
poignant memory of their winter life down there when his
mother had been alive and they had all been young and gay.
The memory faded almost at once. “Then I might as well
be off some day this week, sir,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better wait till after Christmas,” said his father.
“Er—Julie’s rather counting on Christmas together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” Stacey assented remorsefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind you have Elijah look after Duke’s feet,” Mr. Carroll
added, in obvious haste to avoid the appearance of sentiment.
“His hoofs were always brittle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So presently, Christmas over, Stacey departed. It was
capitulation, but he did not care about that. The only thing
that interested him—and this but idly—was that he should
so crave to get away from men and women when men and
women had become such intangible phantoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest, there was only the heavy sense of Phil’s
death and of Catherine bearing up under it bravely.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>PART II</span></h1></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was afternoon on the last day of December when Stacey
arrived at the little station of Pickens, North Carolina. His
face had a sunken ravaged look, and grime from the repulsively
dirty train made its underlying pallor ghastly. But
Stacey was not really in any such abject condition as he appeared
to be. He was worn out, beaten back at every point,
but something in him still hung on; his eyes were tired but
alive. In the train, which was crowded, as only a branch-line
train of the Southern Railway can be crowded, with commercial
travellers and with slovenly mothers publicly nursing
crying children much too old to be nursed either publicly or
privately, he had listened with even a little amusement to talk
of how much better the service would be as soon as the
government turned the road back to the company; and his
will to get away by himself, out of touch with men and
women, was strong and intense, sustaining him. He was
not repelled by the sordid ugliness of the station and the
glimpse of Main Street, but felt rather an unemotional sense
of home-coming, which any native of Pickens would have
attributed to the fact that Stacey’s mother’s people, though
now all dead or widely scattered, had been the Pickens Barclays,
but which more likely arose in Stacey because the
end of his quest was in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyway here came old Elijah, grinning broadly, hat in
hand, his fringe of white hair blowing about his nearly bald
black head. He shook Stacey’s hand vigorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shuah almos’ thought you wasn’t on that theah train,
Mistuh Stacey,” he declared. “Theah didn’ seem nothin’
but babies.” And he carried Stacey’s bag across the platform
to a buggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” said Stacey, “you’re driving Duke! What will
Mr. Carroll say to that, Elijah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mistuh Stacey, suh, I jes’ had to get you home
somehow. These heah Fohds at the garage, jes’ as like as
not they get stuck on the Meldrun road. I wouldn’ have
drove Duke ’cept foh that. It’s been rainin’ a powehful
lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t they mended that road yet?” Stacey inquired,
getting into the buggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, suh, not yet. You stop that, Duke, suh!” he called
to the horse, who, impatient of the shafts, was curveting
sideways down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two or three people came up to the buggy and shook
Stacey’s hand, and he replied to their greetings as heartily
as he could; but he was eager to be rid of them, and felt
relief when presently the town was left behind and the
buggy was ploughing through the waste of red mud known
as the Meldrun road. He lit a cigarette and leaned back in
the seat, drawing in deep breaths of the damp chilly air,
and letting Elijah’s words run on unchecked and unheeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landscape was a sweet and pleasant one even now in
winter when the oaks and the poplars were bare of leaves.
The rolling brick-colored fields, planted with corn, were interspersed
with patches of woods, where hills rose, blue with
spruce and dark green with white pine. Beyond were the
low friendly mountains. Log cabins were scattered about
here and there, with pigs, dogs and ragged children playing
indiscriminately before them. All the people Stacey met or
passed on the road raised their hats gravely, and Stacey
raised his in return. He was enough of this country, and
also sufficiently intelligent, to have no sentimental northern
fancies about its romantic aristocracy. He had no more
illusions about the people of Pickens than about the people
of Vernon. If the latter were vulgar, the former were
bigoted. There greed took on gigantic forms; here it revealed
itself in petty ways. Here, as there, he thought, it was the
one permanent human instinct. He did not know what labor
conditions were now at the knitting mills; he knew what
they had been six years ago, the last time he had been
down, and he was skeptical of any change. Yet the sight
of people here bothered him less than in Vernon, it seemed.
That, he thought idly, was because here the inhabitants
were more a part of their country, stood out less blatantly
against the landscape, blended with it—or almost. Not because
they and it were picturesque, but because they had
belonged to their country for many generations, whereas in
Vernon nobody had been molded by continuous residence
into harmony with anything. And Stacey reflected that only
in rural New England and the South did you get this impression
of harmony between landscape and people, as
though they had mutually made one another. Really they
were at bottom very alike, rural New England and the
South, though each would have been shocked at the idea.
Each with a continuous past from which it had sprung, to
which it belonged. A tight, narrow, little past, but
authentic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was roused from meditation by a sense that Elijah
had been saying the same words a great many times, and
that the words were a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s that, Elijah?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was jes’ sayin’, Mistuh Stacey, as how I reckoned
you’d be wantin’ some colohed girl to cook foh you an’ make
youah bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Stacey calmly, “I don’t want any one. You’ll
do that, Elijah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man grew melancholy. “Shuah, Mistuh Stacey,
if you say so,” he replied sadly. “I’ll wohk myself to the
bone foh you, but I jes’ don’ know if I positively got the
time to do everythin’ jes’ right. I got a powehful lot to do,
Mistuh Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Elijah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I got to look afteh Duke, suh, an’ then theah’s all
that big place to see to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A couple of men working on it, aren’t there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, suh, but that’s jes’ it. They don’ wohk ’less’n I
stan’s oveh them all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They probably don’t work if you do. I don’t want a
maid, Elijah. You can hire a woman to come in and clean
for a couple of hours in the morning, but I don’t want to
see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, suh,” said the negro, in a tone of aggrieved resignation.
But he got over it almost at once, with quick forgetfulness,
and was presently babbling on as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When at last they approached the Carroll property Stacey
looked about him more attentively, with a wistful sense of
what was past, such as one might feel in reading over old
letters, full of youthful affection, to some one all but forgotten
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house, three miles distant from the town, was low
and rambling, with deep verandahs and numerous sleeping-porches.
It sat on a knoll among ten acres of sloping lawn
and perhaps ninety of oak and pine woods; and from its
front verandah one looked away, west, for miles up a narrowing
valley between tree-clad mountains. “Valley Ridge,”
Stacey remembered, half humorously, half painfully, Julie
had tried to call the place in her boarding-school days, and
had come down one Christmas vacation with heavy blue
stationery embossed in silver with that legend; at which
their father had remarked that if she ever used any of that
“Princess Alice abomination” he’d get some pink paper for
himself, have “The Pig Sty” engraved for a heading, and
write letters on it to the principal of Julie’s school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was odd, Stacey thought, that the recollection of this
trivial incident should remain in his mind as something
touching, more touching than the memory of really emotional
events—his mother’s death, for instance. How things
clung—the absurdest things! One could never get rid of
them. They were like tattered cobwebs in corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they had reached the end of the driveway by now,
and Stacey sprang out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper he sat, huddled in an overcoat, on the wide
front verandah of the house. The low mountains, only a mile
to the north, were hazy blue in the twilight. Later the moon
rose, and soft brightness spread over everything. Straight
ahead the narrow valley took on shimmering pearly tints,
range after luminous range of mountains intersecting its
sides, like filmy theatre-drops in a stage setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of this pale silence a sense of reposefulness
came over Stacey. It did not spring from any achieved harmony.
He had harmonized nothing. He had, as he was
perfectly aware, merely bolted. And nothing that he had
felt was gone. His pain at Phil’s death, his compassion
for Catherine, his hatred of men, his resentment at this rag
of a world,—all this and everything was still alive within
him, but submerged beneath his isolation. When he thought
of men he still thought of them as greedy beasts of prey;
but it was possible for him now, he believed, not to see them
and be one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, when it had grown very late, he went up to the
bed Elijah had made for him on a sleeping-porch, from
which, too, he had the same view of the shining valley; and
so fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now began for Stacey as solitary a life as that of
any medieval hermit. Every morning he went out on Duke
for a fifteen- or twenty-mile ride over mountain roads and
paths, returning splashed with mud and frequently drenched
through, for the season was exceptionally rainy. And after
the late cold luncheon which he trained Elijah to leave
spread out for him, he would set off again, on foot, for
the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letters that came for him he tossed unopened into the
library desk, except those from his father and Catherine.
Theirs he read, but hastily, and replied to them with an
effort. He did not so much mind reading or even answering
Mr. Carroll’s; he did so almost mechanically. But Catherine’s
were different. Matter-of-fact and never touching
on general ideas, they were yet, in some cool way, intimate,
and certainly without the shyness that had always
hampered Catherine in talking to Stacey. It was as though
in these letters she assumed that he was real, as he felt that
she was. And this was painful to him, dragging him back
into the world from which he had fled. Writing to her was
hard, and he was aware that his letters must be dull. But
Catherine did not write often—only once every two or
three weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey also read a letter from Julie. But Julie was a poor
correspondent, writing, when positively forced to, in an odd
stilted manner quite uncharacteristic of her pleasant self.
Only this one effort came from her; but Stacey would not
have minded fifty letters as unreal. The postscript, however,
did sound like Julie, and brought Stacey back for a
moment to Vernon. “How did Irene know where you were
when Phil was dying?” it demanded. Oh, so it was Irene
who had told Julie, and Julie Catherine, that he was at
Clarefield! He stared ahead of him, recalling the tragedy;
then laid Julie’s letter among the others in the desk drawer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few people called on Stacey, and he was polite enough
to them; but he never returned their visits, and soon no one
troubled him further. It was a difficult matter to drive out
from town through all that mud. When, rarely, he did
talk with people he received an impression that they were
literally very far off. Their voices seemed to reach him
from a distance, or deadened as though through a barrier of
fog. It was like conversation in a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes on his rides he would get so far away or be
caught in so terrific a storm that he would stay over night
in some mountaineer’s cabin. On these occasions he was
welcomed with a grave courtesy unmarred by apologies for
what his hosts had to offer. The cabin invariably had but
one room and a lean-to. Supper over, the women would go
to bed, while the master of the house and Stacey smoked
their pipes outside. Then the two of them would enter, undress
in the dark, and lie down together. It did not irk
Stacey to be with these people. They seemed apathetic
and emotionless, and their eyes had an abstracted look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, if human feeling had faded in him, his
long neglected fancy was waking to new life. His mind
grew, like an enchanted wood, into a tangle of imaginings,
that gave him sometimes a feeling of release, a lifting sense
of delight. Similes flitted through it rapidly. A cloud
shadow on a blue mountain was like a veil flung across the
face of a goddess, heightening her loveliness. The sudden
sound of a brook in the forest was like shy laughter. What
was laughter? Something delicately unhuman, perhaps, an
expression of the youthful buoyant relation between earth’s
creatures and the earth. Biologists said that animals could
not laugh. Idiotic! It was only animals and children that
could laugh. A dog laughed. Even Duke could laugh. It
was true that cats could not, but this was because they were
not primitive animals, but civilized. Men did not laugh.
They smirked or—or—<span class='it'>ricanaient</span>. Stacey could not think
of the English word and indolently did not try to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He noted with calm contempt this revival of fancifulness
in himself, saying that he had reverted to the sentimentalism
of his early life. For all along he was contemptuous of
himself for his surrender. Further than this he would not
look. He avoided himself as persistently as he avoided
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet in his reading he did not turn to poetry and romance.
He read Tolstoy, Samuel Butler and Thomas Hardy. He
cared, in fact, for no books that did not treat solely and
squarely of men’s relations to one another. He would have
nothing to do with men; he would read of nothing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Months passed, with Stacey scarcely aware of their
smooth succession. He was like a man asleep, vaguely
dreaming. But it <span class='it'>was</span> only a sleep, a semi-conscious state
into which one sinks, however pleasantly, when tired. Even
in those moments when his fancy played delightedly over
some sudden glimpse of beauty he was at bottom dissatisfied—like
a man struggling achingly in a dream to enfold and
make real the unsubstantial vision of his mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time April had come. The Judas trees had burned
themselves out, the fresh pale green of oaks and maples
shimmered against the dark green of the pines, the forests
were white with dog-wood blossom, and on the lower mountain
slopes masses of flame azalea made the ground beneath
the trees appear on fire. Much of Stacey’s present calm
came through his freedom from men; but much, too, from
the silent satisfaction of his starved sense of beauty. He
read less now and went on longer rides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his calm was insecure. Something impetuous fluttered
within him, too strong for this life of fancy. Mentally
he was still isolated; physically he was restless, stirred
tumultuously by the spring, called to union with the warm
thrilling life all about him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>About a quarter of a mile from Stacey’s house lay the
village of Meldrun, straggling along one side of a small
river, which, having flowed prettily through the Carroll
property, its steep banks massed with rhododendrons, issued
thence into practical life, like a business man after a condescending
hour with the arts. It fell, that is, into rapids,
the water power from which was utilized by a small hosiery
factory. Around this plant had grown up the village, consisting
of a company store and of some fifty incredibly
abject huts, leaning at strange angles, propped up anyhow,
when in acute danger of collapse, by logs; the effect of the
whole like that of a Vorticist picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beginning of many of Stacey’s rides led him perforce
through this ignoble place. The brick factory itself stood
close beside the road he must follow, on a narrow strip of
ground between it and the river, and through the broken glass
of its windows slovenly girls leered out at him or shouted uncomplimentary
remarks, and he could see the pale, hard-featured
faces of ten- and twelve-year old children. If
Stacey was walking Duke, he would wave his hat as he
passed, but mostly he went through the town at a gallop.
He rode well, and with his impassive, rather stern face, he
must have looked like some callous medieval <span class='it'>condottiere</span>.
No one in Meldrun would have heard of <span class='it'>condottieri</span>, but the
effect would be the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Really, however, Stacey was far from impassive. This
misery of which he caught a glimpse troubled him profoundly,—the
more since, so far as he could see, there was
nothing he could do about it. Yet, oddly, he rode through
Meldrun oftener than he needed to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house of the factory owner, a Mr. Langdon, stood on
the crest of a low hill some distance back to the left just
before the village began; on one side its grounds adjoined
the Carroll property. It was an imposing pillared mansion
built as a plantation house before the Civil War, but Stacey
gazed across at it grimly each time that he rode out through
Meldrun. However, he did not see what he could do about
this, either. He tried to dismiss both house and village from
his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Langdon himself, a pleasant-faced elderly man with
a young wife and three small daughters, he knew by sight
and nodded to curtly when they happened to meet. But, for
all his deliberate isolation, he had been unable not to pick
up a few scraps of gossip here and there, and also there was
Elijah, an unquenchable fountain of information. So
Stacey learned that the Langdons were a South Carolina
family; that they had formerly owned the house and a
thousand acres round about—the whole valley, indeed, including
the property that was now Mr. Carroll’s; that they
had lost everything during the Civil War and emigrated to
Georgia; and that it was only five years ago that the present
Mr. Langdon had returned, to buy back the family home and
with it the hosiery factory that had been erected by some
one else. Stacey also learned, listening distractedly to Elijah,
that there was no love for the factory owner among his
employees, and that that one young fellow—“yes, suh, he’s
<span class='it'>bad</span>, Mistuh Stacey!”—had said “how he was goin’ to <span class='it'>get</span>
Mistuh Langdon one day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—and then?” thought Stacey, with a shrug of his
shoulders, finding the intention laudable enough, but seeing
no solution of anything in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But one night toward the end of April Stacey, lying awake
on his sleeping-porch, became aware of an odd glow in the
moonless night. “A fire, of course,” he thought, as he got
quickly out of bed to make sure that it was not in his own
house. Houses hereabouts always burned down sooner or
later, what with the general carelessness and the lack of any
fire department. But from his porch, which faced west,
Stacey could not see the fire. It must be somewhere to the
east, since it reddened the near side of the shrubbery on
the lawn and shone fantastically against the glossy leaves of
a tulip tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hurried down the hall to the other end of the house.
But tall trees and the distant barrier of white pines that
marked the Carroll boundary cut off his view, and he could
make out only that the fire was somewhere in Meldrun.
The confused murmur of many voices reached him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw on some clothes, slipped an electric flash-light
into his pocket, then ran downstairs. Elijah was just starting
up then. The old man was breathless with haste and
excitement. “It—it am Mistuh Langdon’s house ’at’s
buhnin’, Mistuh Stacey!” he stuttered. “My Lawd, but she
shuah is buhnin’, suh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Stacey was rather pleased at the news;
then he shrugged his shoulders at feeling so childish an emotion.
“All right,” he said, “I’ll go over and see if I
can help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running easily, he did the quarter of a mile in three
minutes, and, vaulting a fence, came out upon the sloping
lawn of the Langdon home. It was covered with people
shouting and moving about busily—mostly workers from the
factory, and strewn with such household goods as had been
rescued. The east wing of the house was burning fiercely;
flames lapped the roof of the central part, and black smoke
curled out of its upper windows. The west wing was not
yet burning, though its blistered paint was peeling off in
great flakes, and little spirals of smoke rose from its roof
where sparks had caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glancing around him in the flickering light, Stacey perceived
a young woman sitting motionless on an overturned
mahogany sideboard, a child in her lap and two others clinging
to her skirts. He went up to her quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Langdon?” he said stiffly. “I’m Stacey Carroll.
Please tell me what to do.” He spoke stiffly not because he
was unfriendly, but because Mrs. Langdon, like all the rest
of the people around him, seemed far away, unrelated, a
mere distant mathematical fact about which no emotion
was possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Carroll,” she said pleasantly. “I’m
afraid there’s nothing. The men are getting out what
they can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can help with that,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youngest child, a girl of six, was crying bitterly in
her mother’s arms. “Mitzi, I want my Mitzi!” she sobbed
monotonously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s Mitzi?” Stacey asked quickly. “Some pet—still
in the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Langdon smiled. “Mitzi is only Helen’s doll,” she
explained. “We forgot it in the hurry, and now it’s too late.
Her room was full of smoke even when we left it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, too, smiled—ever so faintly touched. “I’ll go and
see if I can help Mr. Langdon,” he remarked. “Where
is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you!” said the young woman. “He’s there
at the west end of the house. Please don’t let him climb
in again. He’s strained his ankle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A ladder had been placed against the low porch at the end
of the west wing. Stacey scrambled up to the roof of the
porch, where he found Mr. Langdon and others among a
heterogeneous collection of household goods that had been
carried out through an open second-story window. The tin
roof was uncomfortably hot, and there was a good deal of
smoke. Mr. Langdon was directing the lowering to the
ground of a sofa and pausing between times to toss down
less fragile belongings as they were brought out to him
through the window. He appeared quite calm and greeted
Stacey courteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Langdon told me you had strained your ankle,”
Stacey remarked. “Hadn’t you better go back down and
let me tend to this for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is very kind of you, sir,” Mr. Langdon replied, “but
I am all right. I regret that I cannot go inside with
the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can do that, anyway,” said Stacey curtly, and,
disregarding the other’s protests, went quickly over to the
window and through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room beyond was very hot but not yet burning, and
there was not even much smoke. Three or four men were
gathering up the few objects still remaining in it, and a
frightened negro servant was standing very close to the
window and directing their efforts. No one paid the least
attention to his instructions, but a youth, coming in with a
mattress from a room beyond, called: “Come on in theah,
Joe!” at which the negro shook his head vigorously and the
others laughed. Stacey went through another door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This room was smoky and also nearly emptied of its
furnishings. But three doors opened out of it and beyond
one of these Stacey found himself at once in a hot choking
mist. Here he was alone. He drew out his flash-light, and,
his eyes smarting, explored the room. It was a sitting-room,
he saw,—Mrs. Langdon’s probably,—and he could be
of some use after all; for here hung a small Meissonier and
there on a table was a vase—“Sèvres,” he remarked
hoarsely. “Better than—mattresses.” He gathered up the
vase, jerked the picture from the wall, and stumbled, coughing,
from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just outside the door he ran into the young man of the
mattress. “Here!” said Stacey wheezing, “take this—carefully—to
Mr. Langdon, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shuah!” said the young man, who was chewing tobacco
steadily. “You be’n in theah?” he inquired, waving his hand
at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, wait a minute en’ I’ll go back in with you when I’ve
toted these out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll—have to—wait a minute,” Stacey replied, and the
young man departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he returned, and together the two went back
into the sitting-room for more loot, emerging dripping with
sweat and half choked. Yet Stacey was beginning to
enjoy himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They tried the other two rooms, the doors of which
Stacey had already noticed. From the first they got—with
difficulty—a fine rug, slightly scorched, and a mahogany
stand. The second seemed impossible—a mass of black
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s in there, I wonder?” said Stacey hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno,” the young fellow replied. “We mout ask that
nigger, Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only two or three men were left now even in the room
next the porch, and Joe was definitely on the point of getting
out of the window. However, he paused for an instant to
answer the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That theah room, that’s Miss Helen’s bedroom. Don’
you go theah, suh,” he said, and vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey reflected, with a half smile, then hurried back, his
laconic acquaintance still at his side. Voices shouted at
them from the porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was a furnace now. There was a heavy roaring
in the air and every little while the sound of something
crashing down. Nevertheless, Stacey plunged into the bedroom,
and so, too, did his companion. It was unbearable,
but, at least, one could see; a vivid flickering light shot
through the smoke. After a moment Stacey made out the
crib, dived for a blackened, almost unrecognizable object
that lay on the smoldering sheets, and leaped back just as a
beam fell, with a shower of sparks, from the ceiling. Together
he and his companion fled back to the room next the
porch and leaned, coughing and choking, against the window.
The room was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wh-what did you get?” Stacey asked hoarsely at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hoss,” replied the other, with a grin, holding up
a toy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got a doll,” said Stacey weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all at once, there in this burning room, it was as
though something snapped within him. The strange barrier
was down. The world came rushing up to meet him. He
burst into a helpless fit of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I—do I look as wild as you do?” he gasped, gazing at
the other’s grimy face and singed hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shuah look pretty bad,” said the young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey pulled himself together. “I should say we’d better
get out of here,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon we had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They scrambled out over the smoking porch and down the
ladder, surprised at the anxious group awaiting them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Langdon seized Stacey’s hand. “Thank God, you’re
down safely, Mr. Carroll!” he said. “We were worried,
sir. You shouldn’t have stayed so long. You’re not burnt?
Your clothes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the things you saved were very
precious to me. That Meissonier .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “Glad to be of some use,” he replied
easily. “Where is Mrs. Langdon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back here out of the heat—just a few steps,” said the
other, and led the way, limping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd had grown larger during Stacey’s absence.
There were half a dozen small motor cars, too, on the lawn,
and the lights of others standing in the road, a hundred
yards distant, were visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Langdon uttered an exclamation at Stacey’s appearance.
But he gave her no chance to thank him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helen,” he called, “is this Mitzi?” and held out the burnt
blackened doll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child seized it, with a scream of joy. “Mitzi! Mitzi!”
she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Langdon stared helplessly. “Do you mean to say
that you risked your life to save—that doll, Mr. Carroll?”
she demanded, half laughing, half crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, there wasn’t any danger—except of choking,”
Stacey replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it occurred to him suddenly that to run risks
blithely for a doll was just what he had done, and that this
was somehow—he didn’t know—connected with the odd
change of heart he was feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he exclaimed suddenly, “and my friend saved a
horse! Where’s he gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got the hoss, Mistuh Stacey,” said Elijah, coming forward
with the toy. “Mistuh Jim Bradley, he give it to me to
bring. He’s done gone, Mistuh Bradley is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was sweet of him!” Mrs. Langdon exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the dickens did he go for?” Stacey remarked
regretfully. Jim Bradley? He’d heard the name
somewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must come over to my place for the night,” he
observed. “No, no, it would be silly to go into town when
I’ve all those empty rooms,” he added quickly, as Mr. Langdon
attempted to protest. “And you’ll want to get back here
early in the morning to see to things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was insistent, and they, no doubt, were very tired. At
any rate, they yielded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cousin of mine has brought his Ford around,” said
Mr. Langdon. “He’ll take us over presently. But—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Then Elijah and I will cut across and get things
ready,” Stacey concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back at the house, Stacey plunged into a bath, then
hurriedly put on other clothes. But all at once he paused in
his dressing and uttered an exclamation. Jim Bradley?
Of course! It was the name of the young man who, Elijah
said, had threatened to “get” Mr. Langdon. Stacey smiled,
then frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long the Langdons arrived, with a car-load of
rescued clothes. Stacey welcomed them cordially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elijah has your rooms ready,” he said, “and there’s a
bathroom next one of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” murmured Mrs. Langdon. “I’ll put the
children to bed and leave you my husband meanwhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He helped them upstairs with their things, looked down
with a smile at Helen, as her father laid her, fast asleep, on
the bed, Mitzi still clutched in her arms, then returned with
Mr. Langdon to the big living-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down, and Stacey gazed at his guest with
interest. A simple likable man, with a kindly face, and
extremely well-bred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust,” said Stacey pleasantly, as he offered him a
cigarette, “that you carried adequate insurance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Langdon smiled faintly. “About enough to cover
the first mortgage,” he returned quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey paused in the act of lighting a match, and stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole investment was a mistake, sir,” his guest
continued mildly. “For sentimental reasons I am sorry to
lose the house, but it was a burden. The factory has never
paid, and the rate of interest banks hereabouts demand on
loans is ruinous—ten to twelve per cent. I shall sell out
for what I can get and go back to Macon. Forgive my
troubling you with such mention of personal affairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary, I am interested—and sorry,” Stacey
replied sincerely. He fell silent for a moment. So the villain
of the piece must be sought elsewhere? Among the
bankers? Stacey shook his head. Not there, either. He
pulled himself back to his duties as host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time Mrs. Langdon came down. She had put on
another dress, and there was a touch of coquetry in her
manner toward Stacey. Both she and her husband were
behaving like good sports, he thought. Elijah brought in
coffee and sandwiches, and the three talked pleasantly together
for half an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, Stacey was relieved when his guests went
up to bed. Somehow he seemed to have broken free; he
was no longer a pacing animal in a cage; and he wanted to
think things out. He leaned against the mantelpiece and
gazed off across the room with grave abstracted eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His absurd rescue of that wretched doll—why had so
trivial an act seemed to shake him out of a long lethargy?
The answer leaped up at him almost at once. Not the
kindness but the sheer futility of his act—just this was what
had struck him as a heartening revelation. He had risked
his life for a doll! Jim Bradley had sworn to “get” an
enemy, then had gone through flames to save his enemy’s
household goods!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, thinking swiftly, Stacey perceived now that he had
not told the truth when he had asserted passionately to Mrs.
Latimer that he found the world chaos—with no scheme,
nothing. What reason for anger in that? No, as a youth, he
had assumed the world to be built upon an agreeable scheme,
and then afterward, all unknown to himself, he had fancied it
an evil scheme. It was neither. It was what he had insincerely
called it—chaos, a grovelling incoherent assemblage
of facts. The thought of greed—he had been obsessed by it
just because he had seen it as something permanent, consistent—and
successful. Pshaw! An ugly thing, greed, but
pitiful and futile, like everything else. Where did it get
any one? The greedy man was a man struggling for happiness.
Well, did he achieve happiness? Hate died out of
Stacey. You could not hate what was a failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much he made out in a series of flashes. Much more,
that lay behind, was obscurer. He dropped into an arm-chair
and sat there, motionless, for a long time, reflecting
intensely. Sometimes he would spring to his feet and pace
up and down the room for a while, and light a fresh cigarette
or pause to finger abstractedly some vase or book,
then return to his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not, of course, he understood, this one evening’s
performance that had shocked him into sanity—or what he
hoped was sanity. This long isolation from men, from a
world interested only in economics, had calmed him; for in
it his youthful gift of fancy, choked back for so long, had
been let loose again. You could not choke things back
without suffering for it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had been like a man living
in compartments—first in one, then in another. That was
wrong. He ought to live wholly, with all of himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What he had been in his youth—that, too, he still was.
Nothing in one ever died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as far as Stacey could get—and this only slowly,
with difficulty. But he could, he thought, go back to the
real world now and start over again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had left Vernon in December; it was on an afternoon
in May that he returned to it. Tulips bloomed gaily
in well tended beds along the boulevard at which he gazed
from his taxi. A fresh spring smell was in the air. The
city was at its best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey looked at it inquiringly, almost as though it were
new to him. And in a sense it was new; for he did not
feel toward it in any way that he had felt before. He saw
the business buildings standing angularly against the blue
sky, the handsome residences of varied architecture, the
wide streets that were rivers of motor cars, and he noted,
as often, that esthetically the city was faulty and aspiring,
and that socially it was energetic and confident. He received
again an impression of people striving relentlessly to
attain certain things and clinging to them desperately when
attained. But he did not feel for these characteristics either
admiration or disapproval, affection or distaste. What he
did feel was curiosity, because it seemed to him that he
knew very little about Vernon really, and an odd touch of
pity. For the first time it struck him as rather pathetic to
care so hard about motor cars and bathrooms and servants.
Here were wealthy men riding triumphantly in imported
Rolls-Royces, and poor men riding in Fords, or walking, and
hating the rich men. What a to-do! Oh, well, it couldn’t
be helped! Stacey supposed. Economics were the order
of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he reached his father’s house. “Hello, Parker,”
he said to the surprised servant who opened the door.
“I’m back, you see,—and without so much as sending
a wire. How are you? Mr. Carroll well? Take this bag
up to my room for me, will you, please? I certainly do need
a bath. Oh, yes, I’ve had lunch, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later he strolled down to the dining-room for a
whiskey and soda, then, glass in hand, into the library.
And there, sitting with a book in a high-backed chair, was
Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Catherine!” Stacey exclaimed, going toward her
quickly and holding out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had risen swiftly, as surprised as he. She was wearing
a black dress, but with a wide pointed collar of white
lace at her bare throat. She looked firm and grave and
slender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, isn’t this jolly?” he said, shaking her hand cordially.
“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you get my last letter?” she asked, with some
embarrassment. “I think your father wrote you, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did get your letter and one from father,” he replied,
“just before I left Pickens, but, to tell you the truth, I’ve
brought them back unopened in my bag. I thought it would
be so much nicer to talk with you both. It sounds rude and
unappreciative, but I didn’t mean it that way.” She was
still gazing at him, and he saw that she was distressed about
something and as shy as ever. “Sit down, do!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed. “You see,” she began slowly, “I didn’t think
you’d be back yet. And a little while ago, when the rent
period on our house was up, your father said—he’s been
so awfully kind to us always—and he said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catherine,” Stacey interrupted, “it’s oppressive to see
any one with as much to say as you always have, so unable
to say it.” (She bit her lip.) “My father said: ‘I insist
on your coming to live here. It’s a big place and I need
a housekeeper.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, though he laughed, Stacey did not feel mirthful. He
had a sudden perception of how lonely his father had been,
how lonely Catherine had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she returned, “that was what he said. And I was
weak enough to accept, though I knew it was only kindness
on his part. But I <span class='it'>was</span> going away when you came back,
Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he remarked, “you were!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she bit her lip. “I mean,” she added quickly, “that
we might have been in your way and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catherine,” said Stacey, getting up and standing beside
her, “I think your being here is delightful. I should feel
very badly if you went away. There’s my hand on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him in a puzzled manner and thanked him,
rather unsteadily, because he had been so cordial. A little
of her shyness had vanished when he sat down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You came back,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “I’d ridden everywhere there was to ride;
so all at once I decided I’d come back to the world.” And
he became silent. “Where are the boys?” he demanded
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At school,” she replied, “but it’s four now. They’ll be
here any minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And only a little later they did come in. Jack was unrestrained
from the first, but Carter, probably coached by
his mother, was impressively correct until he caught sight
of Stacey and threw reserve to the winds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The library echoed with noise and there was a touch of
color in Catherine’s cheeks when at five o’clock Mr. Carroll
opened the door of the room and stood at the threshold,
looking in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, son!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey sprang up. “Surprise party, dad!” he remarked,
shaking his father’s hand. “Quite a good one, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so!” Mr. Carroll replied, while Catherine
quieted the boys and made them sit beside her with a book.
“How was everything down there? Did you ride over that
Garett Creek path you and I found once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Stacey, “there and everywhere else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the initial burst of cordiality they fell silent, finding
little to say to each other. How estranged they were!
Stacey thought. The murmur of the children’s voices and
the subdued sound of Catherine’s words explaining a story
were comforting—to Stacey certainly, to his father almost
as certainly—filling in the emptiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll called Jack to him—Jack seemed to be his
favorite—and joked with the child much more naturally
than he could joke with Stacey. As for Stacey, he talked
with Catherine and Carter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while Catherine announced to the boys that it was
half-past five and they must go wash and get ready for
dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Catherine!” remarked Mr. Carroll. “Do let
them eat with us to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! Oh, yes, mother!” they cried in unison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “No,” she said to them, “do as
mother says,” and they went out slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please!” she replied to Mr. Carroll. “It’s awfully—good
of you, but I’m sure it’s better this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll frowned. “Idea of Catherine’s,” he said,
appealing to his son. “Boys must eat at six—an hour ahead
of us. I’d like to have them at table with me. Can’t you do
anything about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine was shy but firm. “I’d rather they wouldn’t,
please,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “Lord! no, I can’t do anything about it!”
he returned. “You have my full moral support, but what’s
the use? Catherine’s the Rock of Gibraltar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father laughed with him and spread out his hands in
surrender. Perhaps he rather liked being successfully
opposed. At any rate, there was less constraint between
him and Stacey after this. If in no other way, Stacey
thought, they could at least be united in a league of men
against women. When Catherine went down to sit at table
while her sons ate, the two men talked quite freely, though
chiefly of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mind my asking her and the boys to come
over here?” Mr. Carroll asked apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was touched. “Good heavens, no!” he exclaimed.
“It’s jolly for us and better for them. It was awfully good
of you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” said his father gruffly. “Purely selfish.
Brightens the house up. Long time since there were children
here. You and Julie <span class='it'>would</span> grow up, confound you!”
he added wrathfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed a little at this. “Couldn’t help it, dad,”
he replied. “I regret it as much as you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine girl, Catherine!” Mr. Carroll went on, after a
moment. “I like her honesty and lack of nonsense. Some
women would have refused to come because damned impertinent
people might talk. They will, I suppose, having
the kind of minds they’ve got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey opened his eyes wide. “I never thought of that,”
he said. “But I should say,” he added, “that if they do,
why, let them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll nodded emphatically. “Let them,” he
assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Stacey and his father were also incongruously united
in a revolutionary league against society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you know what Catherine does, confound her!”
Mr. Carroll added. “Insists on paying me the same amount
as it cost her to live in that other house! Says she won’t
stay otherwise!” He laughed, half admiringly, half in
exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey enjoyed himself, in a mixed way, at dinner.
Indeed, he was never really bored. He had loved life once
and hated it later. Indifference was impossible to him,
however much his attitude toward things altered. He
looked across the table at Catherine, studying her firm grave
face over which her grief had lowered an intangible something
like a veil, an expression of reserve, sweetness and
knowledge. At bottom Stacey was rather afraid of
Catherine. And, while conversation ran on well enough, he
studied his father’s face, too. What an odd trio they made!
he thought. And he noted that his father’s expression was
stern to harshness when Mr. Carroll talked of general subjects
such as the present Democratic administration or
Article X of the League of Nations, but softened when he
spoke to Stacey or Catherine of individual things or people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just at present he was talking about the state of the whole
country, and, as the subject was especially large, he looked
especially fierce, his white eyebrows meeting in a frown
above his fine nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country’s had enough of Wilson and his policies,”
he was saying. “You can go way back to his action in
knuckling down to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
if you want to get at the start of the whole trouble.
A toady! A trimmer! A schoolmaster! Yes, sir! The
world has taken Wilson’s measure pretty well by now.”
Mr. Carroll drank a swallow of claret, then set his glass
down with a bump. “Then the Armistice!” he burst out
again. “Look at that! All Wilson with his idiotic Fourteen
Points and his ‘Peace without Victory!’ There we had the
Germans on the run. Two weeks’ time—a month—and our
boys and the Allies would have marched into Berlin, and
then we’d have known who won the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll did not stop here by any means. He continued,
sweeping along like a surf-rider on the flood of
his indictments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey lost track. He remembered, as something out
of a dim different past, that he had countered this same
argument in regard to the Armistice at dinner that first night
of his return, and that he had then apparently convinced
his father. However, this awakened no antagonism in
Stacey. He merely felt amused. Somehow, in some way
not yet clear to himself, he had most certainly changed. He
was recalled to the present by the vigor with which his
father pronounced the word “Bolshevism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the whole trouble—Bolshevism! The country’s
rotten with it, and will be until we get a sane business
administration and put labor and radicalism in their place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll was carving a chicken at the time—he
scorned effeminate households where the carving was done
in the butler’s pantry—and he thrust the fork deep down
across the breast-bone of the chicken as though he were
impaling Lenin, Gompers, Haywood, and Daniels all
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a moment later, and quite instinctively, he laid the
liver and the heart beside a drumstick on Stacey’s plate; and
at this Stacey was touched, for he knew that, like himself,
his father had retained a boyish love of the giblets. Often
he had seen his father on looking through the ice-box of a
Sunday night turn around and hold out with a triumphant
smile a plate of chicken where reposed, brown, crisp and
indigestible, a cold gizzard and perhaps a heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So: “I think you are very likely right, sir,” said Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, it cost him little to say this; for he
found himself quite without interest in Bolshevism, the
labor problem, or the Democratic maladministration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Mr. Carroll, he gave his son a pleased, rather surprised
smile, and presently dropped all problems. But
Catherine looked across at Stacey with a strange startled
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner they went into the library and Catherine
poured coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish, Catherine,” Stacey exclaimed, with a touch of
exasperation, “that you wouldn’t glance at me in such a
confoundedly apprehensive way, as though you were afraid
I might object to your pouring coffee here! I like it. How
many times must I tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, Stacey, I’ll try to be bold,” she replied, a faint
smile relieving the gravity of her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll laughed approvingly. “You’re going to be a
great help to me, son,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Parker came in to tell Mr. Carroll that Long Distance
was calling him on the ’phone; so Stacey and Catherine
were left by themselves for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any one not knowing my father well might think, to hear
him talk of Bolshevism and labor, that he was harsh,”
Stacey observed. “He’s not. He’s not even bigoted, really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m sure he’s not!” Catherine exclaimed. “He’s the
kindest man I’ve ever known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You see, partly it’s because he himself has worked
all his life like three ordinary men and, conceding the system,
has made his fortune honestly. It isn’t merely that he
wants to hold what he’s acquired. It’s rather that unconsciously
he feels any attack on the system as an attack on
his own integrity.” Stacey paused, with a frown. “It’s
something even more than that,” he continued slowly. “If
a man has all his life played the game vigorously and loyally
according to the rules, he doesn’t at sixty-one want to be told
that the rules were all wrong. That would be knocking
everything from under him. Father has to believe that what
is is right, or where would he be? Right and wrong mean a
great deal to him—he’s old-fashioned in that. And then, I
must say, it <span class='it'>is</span> a slovenly world at present for a man with
clean-cut ideas to look out on. A bedraggled tattered place,
with cocky young chaps sitting in literary offices and blithely
announcing every week that something else is wrong with
things in general. Not that there isn’t enough that’s
wrong, and the more truth that’s told about it, the better;
but a lot of the complaining is either whining or
just rotten cleverness. Fancy being clever about a cyclone—or
the Judgment Day!” He paused and lit a
cigarette. “Father’s an out-and-out idealist,” Stacey concluded.
“He’s got to believe passionately in something, and
he’s too old to believe in something new. Besides, nothing
new is clearly presented to one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Catherine said, “that is very clear and fair,
Stacey.” But the look that her dark eyes gave him was full
of perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he observed lightly, “I know! You think I’m a
reformed character. Not a bit of it! ‘Nothing of me that
doth fade, but doth suffer a sea-change into something rich
and strange.’ ” He laughed ironically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Catherine was much too shy, as he knew she would
be, to pursue the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When later he went upstairs he stood for a long time
before the open window of his study. “It can’t be done,” he
said to himself at last. “You can’t look at the world as a
whole and stay sane. Because there isn’t any such world.
That’s a nightmare of ogre words. Bolshevism, labor
problem, greed, reaction,—they’re merely words. All that
there truly is is a lot of puny little men like myself, dreaming
dreams—mostly bad ones.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At nine the next morning Stacey drove down town with
his father. Perhaps no real intimacy was possible between
them, since they had hardly a thought or a belief in common,
but they were, simply through a heightened mutual friendliness,
closer together than they had been for six years.
Stacey went up to his father’s pleasant office and watched
Mr. Carroll sit down in his swivel-chair, light a cigar, and
open his letters with a paper-knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled. “I’ve sometimes wondered, sir,” he said,
“why at sixty or thereabouts you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Here! Stop it!” Mr. Carroll interrupted
ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyway I’ve wondered why you didn’t retire and
just amuse yourself, since you’ve certainly earned a rest.
But—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Retire? Nonsense! Work,—that’s all a man’s good for.
Got to stay in harness. Soon as he gets out of it he goes
to pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said Stacey banteringly, “that’s the theory, of
course. But just look around you. Here you come down
to a bright jolly office entirely cut off from the home, and
open nice crisp new letters, and call in—presently, when I
stop bothering you—a fresh clean stenographer, and you
watch the blue smoke of a good cigar curl up across the
sunlight—no, sir, you can’t fool me with any talk about duty
and the rest. Poetry! Sheer poetry! Men’s ingenuous
little romance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll leaned back in his chair and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“American business men,—why they’re our real leisure
class!” Stacey concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this his father protested. “I worked ten hours a
day and sometimes twelve—hard—from the time I was
eighteen till past forty,” he observed soberly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you did, sir,” Stacey assented respectfully. “I’m
not talking about that epoch but about our own. The young
business men I know—and I don’t mean the clerks, people
working on a salary, but the men who will be rich one day
from business—how about them? They get down to their
offices anywhere from nine-thirty to ten, and they waste a
good half-hour before they begin to work, and they play a
lot even when they think they’re working; then they take
an hour and a half off at the club for lunch; at four or
thereabouts, weather permitting, they motor out to the
country-club and play nine holes of golf; then they go back
to a nice, different, clean house, with all the housekeeping
tended to by their pretty wives. Oh, it’s a hard life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right,” the older man growled. “It’s a damned
lazy life, and I don’t know what the country’s coming to if
it keeps on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now really,” Stacey suggested, “<span class='it'>can</span> you blame a laboring
man if he kicks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this Mr. Carroll’s mouth shut in a tight line. “I’m
against loafing anywhere in any class,” he said sternly.
“The laborer’s got his job and he loafs on it; the young
business man has his and <span class='it'>he</span> loafs. I disapprove of both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Stacey returned mildly, “but the results are so
disproportionate. The young business idler has a far
more luxurious time than the most conscientious laborer
could have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on a point like this Mr. Carroll would never yield an
inch. “Labor is getting a bigger reward for less work than
it ever got before,” he said. Then he changed the subject.
“You know, son,” he remarked, with a sudden smile, “to
see you sitting there brings back so many things. I can’t
get over the feeling that you’re a boy, as you used to be, and
have come up and made yourself agreeable in preparation
to touching me for money. You don’t need money, do
you?” he asked wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, no!” said Stacey, who had just ten dollars to
last the rest of the month. He would have liked to oblige
his father, but he really couldn’t, in this. He got up to
go, and Mr. Carroll touched the button that would summon
his stenographer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll run along now and leave you in peace,” Stacey observed.
“I’m going down to see if Parkins will give
me a job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Mr. Carroll lifted his head quickly and gave him
a sharp look. “Just a minute, Ruth,” he said to the young
woman who had opened the door. “I’ll ring for you again
presently.” She went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll gazed at his son with interest. “Going back
to work, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” said the older man sharply. “How would
you like a job with me? Lots of big things you could
work into.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey hesitated. He would have done a great deal to
please his father. But after a moment he shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” he replied reluctantly. “I’d like it; honestly I
would. It would be a fascinating new game. But architecture
is the one thing I know about. You gave me years
of study in it. I’d better stick to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father nodded. “Right!” he said. “I can see that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later Stacey opened the door of Mr.
Parkins’s private office. “Hello!” he remarked. “Can I
come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Stacey!” cried the architect cordially. “How
are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First-rate. Got a job for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Parkins stared at him with a humorous smile. “<span class='it'>Now</span>
what have you gone and done—reformed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “Not so far as I know,” he said lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you must have acquired grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey waved the suggestion aside deprecatingly. “No,”
he said, “but I’ll tell you the truth. I’ve worried my head
too long about the problems of the universe. Everybody’s
doing it. A mistake. Work’s all there is for a man—not as
a drug, but just because it’s the only thing he knows about
and can take hold of.” And Stacey had not equivocated.
As far as it went this did seem truth to him—just a fragment
of the truth. “How about that job?” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! Glad to have you. We need you badly. Hadn’t
found any one to replace poor Phil Blair. My offer’s still
open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Stacey, suddenly grave at the mention of Phil,
“take me on for a couple of months at the old salary. Then
if I’m any good you can repeat your offer if you want to.
I may have forgotten everything I knew. Tell me,” he
added, suddenly feeling all this as of very little importance,
“how did Phil do? Tell me about Phil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most lovable chap I’ve ever known,” said Mr.
Parkins soberly, “and he worked very hard—too hard. I
could have cried when I heard he was dead. But he wasn’t
the best man for the place. You would have been better.
Odd, that power in any one so frail! I felt as though I
were hiring Bramante to design bath-tubs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The architect smiled suddenly. “I didn’t mean what I
said to sound uncomplimentary to you,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Stacey impatiently, “I never thought of that.
I’ll be down ready to work at nine to-morrow morning.
Good-bye.” And he left the office abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was again on the street he hesitated for a moment,
then set off on foot for his sister’s house, two miles
distant. But the mention of Phil’s name had thrown him
into so deep a preoccupation that he walked mechanically,
hardly aware of his surroundings, and did not even notice
the greetings people waved at him from passing motor cars.
He had neglected Phil for chimaeras, he mused sadly.
When you thought about life as a whole it was horrible—and
dead—a cold motionless monster that froze your veins.
Real life, good or bad, wretched or happy, but warm, was
in personal relationships—and nowhere else. He had let
veil after gray veil of bleak abstractions descend between
himself and Phil, obscuring this warmest and freshest of
realities. And now Phil was dead. So Stacey meditated,
but without bitterness; for there was a kind of fatalism
upon him. Whatever was, was. Well, there was still
Catherine. Perhaps he could make it up to her a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when at last he mounted the steps of his sister’s
house his melancholy fled; for he was genuinely eager to see
Julie and was glad when the maid told him she was at
home—out in the garden behind the house, he learned, and
made haste to join her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Stace!” she cried joyfully at sight of him, and
threw her arms around him in a warm hug, taking care to
keep her gloved hands, which were muddy with weeding,
from touching his coat, and laughing because of doing so.
“I <span class='it'>am</span> glad to see you! I only heard this morning. If I’d
known last night we’d have been around to the house. Why
didn’t you call me up? How fit you’re looking!” And
she drew away to gaze at him, while he dropped down upon
a bench and looked back, smiling, at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was plump and sweet-natured, Stacey thought, and
in the bright May sunlight her complexion showed, undamaged,
that clear healthy freshness which can be retained
only by decent living. He was glad to be with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy and Junior both well?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid! Jimmy’s getting rather fat, and I—well, you
see! So we’re both dieting. We sit with a book propped
up in front of us and count the calories in everything.”
She laughed and sat down beside her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much happiness,” said Stacey. “Not enough conflict.
You and Jimmy ought to fight more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was wondering about his sister. Could it really be
that she encountered no problems at all? There was a
sweetness and a sureness about her that made him doubt
such an obvious hypothesis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stay to lunch, Jule, if you’ll ask me,” he began, “because—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will! How nice!” she interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Because it will be my only chance for a while. I’m
going back to work with Parkins to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m glad!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you? Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him rather shyly, frowning a little. “Because,”
she said after just an instant, “you have so fine a
training it seems a shame to waste it and let houses be
built more clumsily by people who haven’t had it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey felt grateful for her reply. She might have said:
“Because I think you’ll be happier,” or: “Because I think
every man ought to do something.” She had their father’s
direct way of going straight to the heart of a question, and
she was so simple about it that she got no credit for intelligence.
What she said always sounded usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went on with her weeding now, and they talked
cordially of superficial things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Junior, back from kindergarten, made himself the centre
of conversation during lunch, but afterward Julie sent him
away with his nurse, and sat down with Stacey in the
living-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was curious, he thought, what a sense of intimacy he
felt, since, except for that one remark of hers, they had
talked only of externals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Julie,” he demanded abruptly, “does everything really
run along for you as smoothly as it seems to? Are you
truly perfectly happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a startled look, her eyes suddenly troubled.
“No,” she said painfully, after a long moment, “I’m not
so—bovine as all that. Oh,” she added quickly, “I get
along! I haven’t any soul tragedies and I’m not in love
with some other man than Jimmy, but there are things”—she
pressed her fingers together nervously—“<span class='it'>different</span>
things—that I’d like to do—or feel. Reckless things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking into her flushed face, Stacey perceived a strange
unknown Julie, and he, too, was troubled and remorseful.
“I didn’t know,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never tried to find out, did you, Stacey dear?” she
replied gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why should you?” she asked, defending him against
her own attack. “Every one’s the same way. They all
think: ‘Oh, Julie,—just the typical housewife!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more fools they!” Stacey muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s natural. I behave that way. I have to behave
some way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a lot to your credit. The world would be smoother
if every one did. Don’t be cross with me for stirring you
up, Jule. It wasn’t nasty—or meant to be. I was only
interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a warm smile. “Of course I’m not cross.
I think it was nice of you,” she said, quite her everyday
self again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps it was because of what he had said that she
ventured, a little later, to bring up another subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey,” she began, rather hesitantly, “I think what
father has done in asking Catherine to stay at the house is
splendid, and I’m truly glad about it. I love Catherine.
But I thought perhaps you ought to know that some people
<span class='it'>are</span> gossiping about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they?” he remarked. “We thought—father and I—that
they probably would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julie looked relieved. “Then that’s all right,” she observed.
“It was only on Catherine’s account that I was
disturbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catherine would mind even less than we.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julie nodded. “And of course,” she went on, “they don’t
dare say anything really nasty—only small catty things.”
She paused for a moment, looking at her brother. “Do
you know who it was that started such talk?” she added
suddenly. “Marian Price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s brows contracted. “Marian?” he repeated
slowly. “What kind of things did Marian say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister’s face was hard. “Oh, that it was all a scheme
of Catherine’s to catch you! And that you were so susceptible
she’d undoubtedly succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey experienced a sudden sick disgust, but the feeling
vanished presently. “Poor Marian!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Marian!” Julie cried. “Why, I’d like to know?
Hasn’t she got what she wanted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Because she doesn’t know what she wants,” Stacey
returned slowly. “She wants so many different conflicting
things, and she doesn’t know what any of them are.
Marian’s wretched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Julie’s eyes were cold. “Anyhow, you’ve been away
this winter, so you don’t know all that I do about Marian.
I’m afraid she’s a bad lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey winced. “No,” he replied, though kindly enough,
“you’re not afraid of that, Julie. You’d rather have it
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister rose quickly and came over to sit beside him
on the davenport. “Yes,” she admitted contritely, “that
was nasty of me. But I can’t like Marian. I never could.”
She gazed at her brother timidly. “Stace,” she said, her
face flushing, “are you—are you still in love with Marian?”
She appeared rather frightened at her own daring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he replied simply, looking straight into his sister’s
eyes. “No. Not any more. Not the least bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julie drew a deep breath. “Then you may be as sorry
for her as you like,” she said happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of their talk was matter-of-fact and trivial
enough. But when Stacey got up to go Julie accompanied
him to the door. She seemed all at once a little uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey,” she remarked, not looking at him and playing
with a button of his coat, “please don’t think from—anything
I said—that I’m not—decently happy. I am; of
course I am. It sounds ungrateful. No one could be
sweeter than Jimmy; and then there’s Junior. I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother laughed. “Don’t be a silly, Jule!” he interrupted.
“I understood perfectly well what you meant.
That, in spite of everything, you did have some thwarted
desires. So has Jimmy, no doubt. So has every one. It’s
just as well, I dare say. There’s been less thwarting than
normally going on these last few years—the lid’s been lifted
a little—and look at the hellish mess! Good-bye. Thanks
a lot. I had a lovely time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he walked away he meditated about Marian. How
she hated him! Oh, not because he had broken their engagement.
In the end she had seen eye-to-eye with him
about that, acquiescing cynically in his second estimate of
her (which, he knew now, had been as false as his first).
She was angry because he had not come to her house that
winter night. He pictured vividly how she must have
looked, what she must have felt, while she sat there waiting
and waiting, till at last, white and still with fury, she
went up to bed. She had offered him all that she thought
she had to give, and he had accepted, then changed his
mind. Consciously superior in morals, she must have
thought him. He hadn’t been, heaven knew! No wonder
she hated him! He had no passion left for Marian—at
least, there was none in the thought of her; there was
no telling what her physical presence might stir up in him—but
he felt a bruised tenderness for her and sorrow that
she should be so wretched. He <span class='it'>had</span> loved her. Her alone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while he came to the park. And there, sitting
on the same bench from which she had called to him that
afternoon when Stacey had broken his engagement to Marian,
he found Mrs. Latimer. But now he saw her first
and stood quite near to her for a full half-minute before
she caught sight of him. Now, as then, she was poking
holes in the gravel with the point of a parasol, but she did
not seem the same, he thought; her pose was tired, and
the droop of her shoulders. When she became aware of
some one’s close presence and looked up he was shocked;
she appeared so old and worn. Then her face flashed into
glad recognition, and the impression lost its acuteness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Stacey,” she exclaimed, “did you drop from the
sky?” She moved over to make room for him on the bench,
and he sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just about a year ago—not quite,” he returned, “that
I found you here in the same place. Only then you had to
call me. This time it’s I who surprise you. I’m awfully
glad to see you, Mrs. Latimer. I was coming to your house
presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you got back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at him with affectionate curiosity. And now
her familiar smile and bearing, all her known quality, was
as a lack of focus in a lens, blurring the objective; yet, even
so, he still felt that she was somehow changed—older, less
resilient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look very strong and composed and sure of yourself,”
she said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I? Well, that’s good!” he returned lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let it go at that, tactfully, and they talked of outside
things,—of his life in Pickens, of Vernon, of how lovely
the month was. About herself Mrs. Latimer said nothing
at all, and this worried Stacey until it occurred to him that
she had never talked of herself, save only, suddenly, on
that one afternoon a year ago here in the park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must come home with me now,” she observed after
a while, “and I will give you tea.” And she got up, rather
wearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her drawing-room was just as he remembered it. The
light gleamed in just the same way from the ivory wood-work
and along the polished surfaces of the same exquisite
vases. But the room seemed to Stacey like a deadened
melody played on muted strings. It was a romantic room
and it needed Marian—the old elfish Marian, slipping in
and out lightly,—to vivify it. He looked around him
dreamily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer had sunk down on a divan and removed
her hat slowly. Now she was leaning back and looking at
Stacey, not so much curiously as wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very good to have you here, Stacey,” she said at
last simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he replied, warmed by her affection and
feeling soothed by the delicate hushed beauty of the room,
which had no connection with the outside world. The
maid brought in the tea things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the water had been boiling in the silver urn for
some little time before Mrs. Latimer finally made the tea.
It seemed to demand a conscious effort for her to lift her
hand to the urn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re tired,” said Stacey suddenly. “Aren’t you feeling
well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started, so that some of the water spilled over upon
the tray; for just a moment she gave him an odd pained
look; then she turned about quickly and laid her head
against the back of the divan. Her shoulders shook with
sobs, and there was fatigue without relaxation in every
line of her taut body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was shocked. He had always thought of Mrs.
Latimer as strong, cool, and too wise to be shaken by any
tempest. He had no idea of what to do or say. Instinctively
he desired to stand near her and comfort her, but he
feared that this would only make things worse. So he
sat silent and gazed at her pityingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while she looked up. “Forgive me!” she began;
then at sight of his expression her mouth trembled and
she cried again. But presently she regained control of herself
and wiped her eyes. Then Stacey saw that she was
an old woman with a weary tragic face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, Stacey,” she murmured unsteadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” he asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing! I just—can’t go on with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was silent for a moment. “It was only because you
were kind, Stacey, and seemed to feel interest in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not mean this as a reproof, he knew, but he was
aware that it was a damning one. Her interest in him had
always been immense and generous; what interest had he
ever shown in her? He had taken her for granted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—there are so many things one doesn’t say—one
isn’t allowed. If I told the truth I should seem shameful,
violating decency.” Her eyes were chilly now and
questioning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” she said suddenly, in a hard voice, “it’s
my husband—or partly. Perhaps he finds me as faulty as
I find him, but, oh, he’s finely greedy, finely futile, finely
avaricious, finely sterile in every human sentiment! I
could bear all those things—perhaps—but for his fineness
in all of them. I can’t live with him any longer. I loathe
him. What have I done with my life, Stacey? I look
down on nothing but ruins. My only child does not love
me, nor I her. What good to bear a child? What is such
a life for? I’ve been tolerant too long. What’s it all about—life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” he said quickly. “You can’t do it that way!
I—I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tone calmed her and she looked at him in a pathetic
questioning manner, as though she, who had always been
like a watchful mother to him, were now his child. He
sincerely did not like to talk about himself; he would always
have an almost fierce aloofness. But he would give
Mrs. Latimer what he could—if there was anything to
give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See!” he said. “Life is—life is a Medusa. Try to face
it and it freezes you to stone. You must look at the—the
mirrored reflection in yourself, in the shield of your own
personality. Then you can see it, without horror, for the
pitiful, snake-crowned, impotently ugly thing it is.” He
paused, with an odd smile. “You even,” he added slowly,
“can see a ravaged beauty in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Latimer stared at him in silence, but the tensity in
her face had vanished, perhaps because she was surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the sword—Perseus’ sword?” she asked finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “that’s as far as the analogy goes. There
is no sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at him with a gentle eager look, and he saw
that he really had helped her—not probably through anything
he had said, but by awakening her capacity for sympathetic
interest in others, her deep altruism. It was of
him she was thinking now—proudly, as though he were
herself. And, much as he disliked to, he would have gone
on and told her everything he knew about himself if she
had asked it. But she seemed to divine the effort he had
made, and asked him nothing further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she cried after a moment, with a tremulous laugh.
“Your tea, Stacey!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it cold, thanks,” he said, also laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after this they managed to talk almost easily of
common things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, having risen to draw a curtain at a window, Mrs.
Latimer suddenly turned about. “Stacey, you must go
now!” she exclaimed. “I have just seen my husband coming
up the street. I couldn’t bear to have you here in the
room with both of us after what I said. I exaggerated.
It isn’t as bad as all that. I shall be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out his hand to say good-bye, but she leaned
forward and kissed his cheek. “Thank you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he left the house Stacey met Mr. Latimer. He looked
like a steel engraving of a gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you’re just going?” he remarked, with his cool polished
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry!” said Stacey. “I must.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey threw himself into work with a cold vigor that had
in it nothing of fad or impulse. He did not find, as he
had feared he might, that he had forgotten much. Everything
came back to him at once; it had all been there,
tucked away, neglected, within him. Neither did he chafe
at the long regular hours he kept, nor feel them burdensome.
In the old days he had perhaps been a little lazy;
it had been hard for him on arriving at the office not to
waste time—over a newspaper or a book-catalogue or anything
that presented itself—before actually beginning his
work; he had crept into work as a swimmer into cold water.
Now there was no indolence about him; the instant
he sat down at his desk he turned his mind on the problems
before him; and, swiftly, intelligently, with intense
concentration, he was soon accomplishing twice as much
as any other man in the office. Indeed, less from a desire
to be always busy than from a kind of impatient thoroughness,
dislike of slovenliness, he often spent hours on drawings
that he might have turned over to draftsmen. But,
though he was extremely interested in his work, there was
no such zest in it for him as he had once felt. Formerly
he had romanticized it, had seen it all as something glowing
and fine. Now it was only rarely that he experienced
a little lifting sense of loveliness. This was when loveliness
was really there to perceive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Parkins, who was something of a dreamer and himself
inclined to waste time, was amazed. He had difficulty
in supplying Stacey with enough to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” he said, before Stacey had been back a
month. “What the devil’s come over you? You’re insatiable!
You turn the work out as though it were arithmetic.”
And he smiled in his uncertain reflective way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, nine-tenths of it,—as unemotional as arithmetic.
Nothing but concentration needed most of the time.
Restful. A mistake to use your soul when you don’t have
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The architect sat down on the edge of Stacey’s desk.
“But,” he suggested tentatively, “you don’t feel your old
delight in it? Or do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When there’s any occasion,” said Stacey. “There, for
instance.” And he pulled from a mass of papers a drawing
of a detail—a wrought-iron balcony for a window.
His eyes showed pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. By Jove, yes! That is good Stacey! Fine and—sure
at the same time. You’re better than you used to
be. For Henderson’s house? Pity it’s so sort of wasted.
I mean, that it won’t be appreciated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t feel that,” Stacey replied. “I feel that it’s
worth while enough to do anything good, even a molding
for a room,—I don’t know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Parkins looked surprised. “Well, that’s the right
way to feel, of course. There’s one thing certain,” he
added, getting up. “You go into the firm the first of the
month. And there’s no favoritism about that, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Stacey. “Thanks. It’s awfully good
of you.” And he went to work again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Mr. Parkins had said was true. Stacey was a
better architect than formerly. He was still affectionately
interested in detail, because that interest had always been
a part of him, and he knew enough now to understand
calmly that nothing in one ever vanished; but he saw things
in a larger, more solid way than once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hammond, a younger man who was put under Stacey’s
guidance, questioned him about Stacey’s preliminary sketch
for a competition. It was of a great stone bridge that was
to cross both branches of the river in the heart of the railway
and warehouse section.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think it’s maybe a little—oh, well, grim, Carroll?”
asked Hammond, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord! man,” said Stacey, “think where it is—mud,
noise, confusion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s just it. Oughtn’t one to brighten the place
up a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey shook his head. “I’m no damned beauty-doctor.
Just the facts—the right ones—in the best way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey played tennis hard for an hour every afternoon
when he had finished work; for his strong body craved
exercise. But his mind did not crave companionship. He
mingled with only a few people, and most of these doubtless
resented his manner as seeming hard and cold. In
this they were wrong. Stacey was merely aloof. He was
not superior, judging these people adversely; he was simply
not letting them in—or himself into them. He had a
feeling that this world of personal relationships was too
rich. It was more like a sea. One might be swept away
futilely on it. Toward those whom he did admit as companions—and
they were sometimes the unlikeliest people—he
was prodigal of interest, in his own different way as
altruistic as Mrs. Latimer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For his hasty luncheon Stacey frequented a small cheap
restaurant near-by. So, also, did Jack Edwards, who had
been commander of the local American Legion post at
the time Stacey had set it in a turmoil, but was so no longer,
having been succeeded by some one less incongruously
radical. The two fell into the habit of sitting down at
table together for their fifteen-minute meal, and Stacey
found himself at once attracted by the other man. Something
in his firm lined face—perhaps the odd expression
of the brown eyes—hinted at a tortured courageous personality.
Stacey was friendly from the first. Edwards, on
the other hand, was in the beginning obviously suspicious.
But he thawed gradually, and the two became friends,
united by some deep, almost unrecognized resemblance between
them. Yet for a long time their talk was hardly
more than casual comment on events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do after lunch?” asked Stacey one June
day, as they pushed back their chairs and rose. “You
must surely take more time off than this before going back
to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” the other replied, “I generally stroll around for
twenty minutes—down to the river sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up to my office and smoke a cigarette, won’t you?
There’ll be no one there for half an hour yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t care if I do.” And the two men paid their checks
and went out together, Stacey walking slowly, since Edwards
limped badly on account of his wounded leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Stacey’s room they sat down, with the littered desk
between them, and smoked silently for some minutes. Stacey
had his feet up against the side of an open drawer, but
suddenly he swung them down and turned to face his
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edwards,” he demanded abruptly, “what do you think
of the war, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The muscles of the other man’s rather stern face contracted
slightly. “Think of it?” he returned. “I don’t
think of it. I don’t want to. Once in a while I dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey considered him with grim comprehension. From
almost any one else the remark would have sounded melodramatic.
Edwards made it quite sincerely, with no
thought of effect. When the raw black-and-white stuff of
melodrama became truth—that was horrible. Stacey shivered.
But after a little he returned to it. “Yes, but I
mean: <span class='it'>do</span> you feel now that it was <span class='it'>all</span> bad, all rotten selfish
commercialism from the very beginning? Oh, you’ve every
right to! I don’t blame you and your people if you do.
But <span class='it'>do</span> you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been tricked,” Edwards replied bitterly, “duped!
And I’ll take that point of view—the one you ask me if I
have—publicly as long as I live. It’s the only way for me
and mine to fight you and yours. Just as the way for your
side to fight is to assert that the war was noble. But—it’s
not so simple. No, I don’t think that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more do I!” cried Stacey. “I hate the war! It
brought out everything rotten that lay hidden in men. But—some
hundreds of thousands of young men did go into it
nobly, and to just that extent it was a decent war. They’re
mostly dead now—worse luck to the world!—and a good
many of those that aren’t are turned beastly by what they
lived through. But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He paused. A kind of dark
light smoldered in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was courage,” said Edwards in a deep voice.
“My God! there was courage! Not your romantic high-adventure
sort, but the sort that could live through mud
and intensive shelling and still push men on, afterward, to
advance. But, oh, Christ! the wasted lives in the Argonne!—thrown
away through sheer incompetence! <span class='it'>Your</span> people
did that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And even so,” said Stacey somberly, “you didn’t see
the Somme.” Suddenly the dull glow in his eyes rose to a
flame. He struck the desk with his clenched fist. “The
thing that gets me, Edwards,” he burst out, “is these
beastly cheap editors of weeklies sitting up and writing
pertly about the war as if it had been all a game of grab,
nothing decent! Damn them! Petty complacent asses!
What do they know about it? What do they know about
physical courage—or any other kind? Have <span class='it'>they</span> suffered?
Have <span class='it'>they</span> fought for ideals and been given dung? The Intellectuals,
they call themselves! An honest protester like
Debs, all right, I’ll respect him. But these vulgar underbred
egotists—faugh! The only ones I hate as much are
the others who sit up and write about how everything was
first-rate—bully war—noble—good clearly coming out of
it!” He ceased, panting with rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t hate so, Carroll,” said Edwards slowly. “Where’s
the good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey drew his hand across his forehead. “You’re
right,” he returned. “It’s idiotic! I thought I’d learned
better. And,” he added, laughing shortly, “fancy wasting
emotion on that tribe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt dizzy and faintly nauseated, as though poisoned,
and he was rather ashamed. It was a flash out of an
earlier side of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Stacey was like a fabric that was being woven together
steadily out of varied strands. But here and there
the woof was faulty; the pattern was broken; threads
stuck out loosely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But moments of hate such as this were rare. Generally
he was cool enough—cooler and perhaps more tolerant than
Edwards, who always in general talk showed himself bitterly
conscious of the “class struggle.” Edwards came up
to the office for a few minutes after luncheon nearly every
day now, and as long as the two men talked personally or
of concrete subjects he forgot his obsession—or, rather,
seemed almost irately unable to apply it in any way to
Stacey; but at the least broadening of the conversation it
emerged, a sullen thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come out to dinner with us some evening, will you?
To-night, if you like,” Stacey suggested once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Edwards shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “Why not? Bound to have no dealings
with the devil or any of his allies? Better come.
You’d like my father. You’d fight with him, but you’d like
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to,” said Edwards. “I don’t want to like
any of your crew. It’s their likableness that I resent. Of
course they’re likable. Why shouldn’t they be? They’ve
leisure and all the appurtenances essential to becoming so.
We’ve got to fight them—you, as class against class.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. Sentiment must be kept out. No fraternizing in
the trenches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards flushed. “You’re too rotten clever, Carroll,” he
replied resentfully. “It’s easy for you to make me appear in
the wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Stacey, “I simply fancy you’re wrong to think
in classes. They’re abstractions. If everybody would drop
them men could meet as men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” exclaimed Edwards, clearly out of patience, “it’s
all very well for you to sit there and talk! You can afford
to be sweetly reasonable. You’re fixed—safe. You’ve
everything. Of course you can talk unselfishly; you can
even talk like a revolutionary. You know damn well there
isn’t going to be any revolution—not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as for that,” said Stacey mildly, “I’ll admit that I
live in a luxurious house with all sorts of comforts—pleasant
enough in their way. Only how much do they amount
to? I’m not essentially soft. I go on inhabiting the place
because it’s there, because I haven’t any particular social
theories (I don’t, for instance, see what good my not living
there would do any one), because of my father, and because
of Catherine Blair, my friend Phil’s widow, and her boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards’ face was crimson. “I didn’t mean what I said,
Carroll,” he blurted out. “I know well enough that—oh,
well, I apologize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shucks!” said Stacey, “that’s all right. It’s a good thing
to look into one’s own existence now and then. For the rest,
I dare say that I’m paid more than I’m worth for my work
here. I can’t tell, and I don’t intend to waste much time
worrying about it. I probably earn more than a skilled
mechanic like you, and that’s wrong. I earn less than a
broker, and that’s wrong. I can, because of my aptitude and
a long training, build decent houses. How’s any one to know
what my exact remuneration should be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Under this system the Lord God Himself couldn’t
decide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I mean—under this system.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was engrossed with the plans for the bridge one
afternoon when the office-boy poked his head in at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady to see you, Mr. Carroll,” he announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Stacey mechanically, not taking it in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when a moment later he looked up to see Irene Loeffler
standing opposite him he fairly gaped with surprise. But
he rose quickly and went around the desk to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you?” he said. “I didn’t hear you come in.
Sit down, do! It’s a long time since I’ve seen you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook hands, dropped his hand quickly, then flung
herself into a chair. She was the same abrupt disconcerting
person as ever. Just now she was a trifle flushed with
embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey sat down near her—but not too near—and considered
her with a polite external gravity. Inwardly he was
amused by the recollection of her advances, somewhat remorseful
at having treated her so roughly, and just a little
apprehensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wanted to see you, Mr. Carroll,” Irene began gruffly,
“and this seemed a good place. Sorry to disturb you,
though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a faint tremor in her voice. Her affectation
of mannishness made her appear only the more feminine,
Stacey thought. In an odd way she was attractive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it! I’m glad to see you,” he replied,
and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Irene swallowed once or twice. “Well,” she said, trying
again for a beginning, “I wanted to tell you something. I
suppose you’ve got a rotten opinion of me. Haven’t you?”
she demanded, staring at him, a sulky childish look about
her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey cordially disclaimed having anything of the sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’d have a right to, I guess. Anyway, what I
wanted to tell you was that I’ve come to my senses. You
haven’t anything to fear from me any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey choked at this and kept his face straight with
difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m engaged to be married to Paul Hemingway.
Know him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine!” said Stacey, laughing in spite of his best efforts.
“Awfully good fellow! I think you’ve chosen well. I’ll
send you a wedding present.” And he held out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not take it. Instead she twisted her handkerchief
nervously around her fingers. Stacey had never seen
any one with so little repose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think,” she demanded abruptly, “that it’s all right
for me to marry him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her. “Why, what do you mean?” he asked,
completely lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I mean,” she said sullenly, her lower lip quivering
like that of a child about to cry, “I mean—after what I said
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey understood now and was touched. “Why, you
silly child!” he exclaimed, “I never heard of anything so
absurd! If that’s the worst thing you ever did you’ve the
purest past in the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brightened, tears of relief standing in her eyes. “But
anyway I must tell Paul about it, mustn’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” Stacey almost shouted, overcome with a mixture
of amazement and admiration. “There’s nothing to tell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Irene wiped her eyes, in obvious resentment at the need.
“All right, then,” she said. “Thanks.” And now she shook
hands. Then she looked at Stacey with a tremulous smile.
“You’ve got a lot of charm,” she announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this he retreated hastily behind his desk, and she
departed, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey thought often of Marian, but he did not see her
until July. He had left the office late one afternoon and was
walking briskly along the boulevard on the way to the tennis
courts when she called to him from her open car. It drew
up at the curb beside him, and Marian reached out her hand
to him gracefully. She was coming from a tea, she said,
and she was wearing a lacy dress of blue and silver and a
drooping picture-hat, white and transparent, that cast soft
shadow over her face without really obscuring it. Against
the deep cushions of the tonneau she looked small, elegant
and sophisticated. It occurred to Stacey that it was nonsense
for him to be concerned about her. Their meeting
must have appeared to an outsider like one of those Salon
pictures of an encounter in the Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking very well, Stacey,” she said gaily, “but
you don’t deserve to have me say so. Here you’ve been back
for two months without coming near me! It’s not
respectful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey laughed. “What a funny word! Well, I will
come. Love to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian’s arm hung limply along the edge of the car. She
drummed idly with her hand against the polished enamel.
And the gesture seemed to sum her up—perfection, graceful
ennui, and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she said, “you’ll just say you’ll come, and that will
be the end of it unless I pin you down. So I will. Come—let’s
see!—come on Monday at five and have tea with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Thanks. I’ll be coming straight from the
office, so I’ll look dingy probably. Hope you won’t mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious, no!” she replied, apparently without malice,
and laughing rather delightfully. “It’s not your clothes I
care about seeing. I’ve <span class='it'>got</span> clothes. Till Monday, then.”
She touched the chauffeur’s back lightly with the tip of her
slender blue-and-white parasol, and the car moved away
smoothly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed after her for a moment, and again he dubbed
himself a fussy fool. He forgot that one’s thought of a
person is direct, without veils; so that in an actual encounter
after long separation one is aware chiefly of the veils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was only his father and Catherine whom Stacey
saw constantly. He spent nearly all his evenings at home.
Sometimes he would read or would merely look on while
Catherine and Mr. Carroll played cards. And he was
amused at this; for he did not think that Catherine liked
cards really. When he thought she had endured enough he
would insist on playing in her stead, declaring that she was
usurping his place in the home. Or, again, they would all
three merely sit and talk. But this made Mr. Carroll restless.
He demanded, Stacey could see, some direct problem, even
if a small one, to occupy his mind. He could talk while he
played cards, but talk was for him no end in itself; it was
a pleasant accompaniment to something else that led
somewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On other evenings, when Mr. Carroll must speak at a
banquet or welcome some visiting potentate of the Republican
Party (Mr. Harding was nominated by now, and Mr.
Carroll, at first disappointed, soon perceived that the choice
was a wise one), Stacey would sit with Catherine or, more
often, walk with her in the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt that he did not know Catherine at all, and he was
aware that this was partly his fault. He had always thought
of her as Phil’s wife, and she still evoked for him the
memory of Phil rather than any clear image of her own.
Yet, though he could not have said what she was like, he
admired her more than any one else he knew. It was no
good to ask himself why. He could say vaguely that she
was clear and cool as deep water .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that she had a profound
truthfulness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that there was a quality of Fact
in her:—what did all that mean? Only once had her personality
touched his in a flash,—on that afternoon when she
had pleaded with him—but commandingly almost, if gently—not
to go to Marian, and he had cut her with cruel words
because he had yielded. He bit his lip in shame at the
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she was so shy, so immensely reserved. She was
not really at her ease with him, he saw, except when the boys
were present or his father. She would talk about herself,
when Stacey questioned her, as though she were talking of
some one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do with your day, Catherine?” he asked
once. “I mean, when the boys are away at school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seemed to startle her, rather. “I—I write, or try
to, regularly, Stacey,” she replied, after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were walking in the garden, and he paused suddenly
to stare at her. “You mean—things to publish?” he cried,
amazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Does it seem incredible? I suppose it does,” she
returned simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No! I don’t mean that! I should think you probably
had more to say than any one else I know, only—pardon
me, Catherine!—oh, well, let’s be frank!—expression
isn’t your forte.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed shyly at this. “It’s easier when you write,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course it must be. What kind of things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little articles,” she replied haltingly. “Mostly for English
papers. It’s hard to get them accepted here. One or two
places—do—sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll let me see them? Please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” she exclaimed, horrified. “And I don’t sign my
own name, so it’s useless to look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re exasperating, Catherine!” he cried, and meant it.
Then he laughed suddenly. “I’ll bet they’re radical—oh,
radical! Tell me, Catherine,” he added maliciously, “when
you’ve gone upstairs after my father has talked about Bolshevism
at some length, do you sit down then and write your
subversive stuff? A double life—that’s what you’re
leading!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed at this and would say no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Stacey’s persistent attempt to get at Catherine was
not the result of mere curiosity, even the curiosity of affection.
At heart he felt vaguely that she was immensely lonely
in her isolation, in great need of sharing her grief for Phil
with some one else. He would have her make such a friend
of him as Phil had made him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In 1910 Harriet Price, Ames’s mother and widow of John
Price, who had been head of the Price Tractor and Motor
Company, built a new house. In 1912 she died, and the mansion,
together with many other good things, among them a
controlling interest in the tractor company, passed to Ames,
the only child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house, which was an immense square building of
yellow stone in the Italian Renaissance style, occupied, with
its grounds, an entire block in the best section of the fashionable
boulevard. Stacey had always rather liked the exterior,
though it was not Parkins and May but a Chicago firm of
architects who had built the house. It was severe, commanding,
less inharmonious in Vernon than most anachronisms,
and the four great chimneys were really fine. Never having
cared for the Prices, Stacey had seen the interior but once—at
a large house-warming affair given in the winter of 1910,
to which he had gone out of curiosity. It had struck him
then as Chicago decorators’ stuff (which it was), proper,
faultlessly in period, quite without character. He remembered
perfectly the dreariness of his impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So now, when he entered the vast hall, his first glimpse of
it made him aware of change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Carroll, sir?” asked the English butler. “Will you
go upstairs, please? Mrs. Price is expecting you there, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Stacey, “half a minute.” He walked quickly
across the hall and stood for a moment at the entrance to
the great drawing-room on the left. As he looked in he
smiled, half appreciatively, half ironically. Change? Well,
rather! To begin with, Marian—it was Marian, of course—had
swept away pretty much everything that had been in
that room when Stacey had first seen it. But, even supposing
the discarded furniture and pictures to have been
sold, he hardly thought the present relative bareness had
saved Ames money. That long table, the Florentine chest,
and the copy of a relief in marble with touches of blue and
gold (Desiderio da Settignano?)—if it <span class='it'>was</span> a copy—h’m!
He turned back. “All right,” he said to the butler. “I’ll
go up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he mounted the broad stone stairway, the man following,
his glance rested on a tapestry—a Medici tapestry, if
he knew anything about it. “Whew!” he thought. But his
eyes were just a little hard now. Marian would take and
take—and give nothing. All the same, what did she get
from it? Again he felt suddenly unreasoningly sorry
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The butler conducted Stacey to the south end of the upper
hall, tapped perfunctorily at a door, opened it, and Stacey
went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room he entered was a small sitting-room—Marian’s
own, most certainly—English in feeling, crowded with a
great many things. Or, rather, no, on second thought
Stacey knew it well:—it was like what pleasant English
people did sometimes to their smallest, best loved room in a
Tuscan villa. The French windows were wide open, but the
heavy wooden shutters were closed to shut out the heat, so
that only a soft summer air entered, with perfumes from the
garden outside. There was a kind of radiant greenish twilight
in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one was there, though a flame burned beneath a silver
kettle, two fragile cups stood ready, and a tea-wagon with
bread and butter and cake was drawn up near the table.
After perhaps a minute Marian entered through another
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was wearing a simple dress of a pearl gray color,
short, as the fashion was, and with a silver cord about the
waist. She looked as Greek as any one or anything modern
could look, and Stacey drew in his breath sharply with admiration
of her beauty. Nevertheless, as he shook hands
with her and replied to her apparently natural greeting, he
was wary. All this delightful readiness for his visit, the
coziness, the shining tea things, Marian herself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “ ‘I
mistrust the Greeks and the gifts they bring,’ ” he said to
himself suddenly, and smiled, finding the quotation apt,
Marian looking as she did. But he kept it to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian sat down at the table, but remained for a moment
gracefully idle, smiling at him, before beginning to make
the tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see all my preparations, Stacey,” she said lightly.
“You see what an event it is when you come. Aren’t you
flattered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I am,” he returned, almost disarmed now by
her remark. And this was true. For Stacey was genuinely
anxious to be friends with Marian. After all, at bottom he
was a simple person. That is, he was complex only on his
receptive side. He could perceive, quite without effort, the
subtlest, most tangled, personal relationships all about him,
whether or not he was himself involved in them; he had
always been able to do this. But the real Stacey Carroll in
the centre of this rich shimmering web remained simple.
The impulses on which he acted were simple, almost boyish
sometimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian and Stacey were both silent while she measured
out the tea and poured the hot water. Gazing at her so
closely, he noted that she was very thin. Her fine pointed
face was almost sharp, and her bare arms, lifted prettily to
the silver urn, were too slender. Stacey was sorry. But,
considering himself questioningly, he recognized that this
half-pity for Marian, together with an artist’s admiration
of her loveliness, was all that he felt for her now. Absolutely
all. No touch of love remained. And Stacey was
immensely relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has to brew seven minutes,” said Marian, glancing at
her tiny turquoise-incrusted wrist-watch, then leaning back
in a corner of her chair and resting her long slim hands on
one arm of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most people treat tea-making so clumsily,” Stacey remarked.
“You make it an art, just as you do with all the
other daily things. They acquire distinction. That’s nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” she said idly, “but it’s only that it tastes better
if it’s made right, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And isn’t that something? Marian,” he added, noting
that her fingers were quite bare, “don’t you wear your rings
any more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced down at her hands. “No,” she said, “I don’t
like them. And they slip off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t let yourself get so thin,” he returned
solicitously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a quick hard smile. “Of course not. I must
keep myself a handsome <span class='it'>objet d’art</span>, mustn’t I? I remember
all about the Parthenon, Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” he answered, discouraged, getting a glimpse of
her antagonism, “I didn’t mean that! I only meant that you
must stay well. What a rotter you must think me, to take
my remark like that! As far as that goes, you’re more beautiful
at present than I’ve ever seen you,” he added simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he saw her bite her lip after her pettish outburst, and
he felt lost—baffled. To save him, he could not make out
what she was after; whether she regretted her spiteful little
attack because it was not in line with a carefully prepared
program or because she merely wanted to be friendly and
hadn’t meant to grow petulant. His mind played restlessly
over the whole situation and could make nothing of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that was rather nasty of me, I admit,” said Marian
after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some little time before she could again conquer
his wariness, but she did so at last. There is a smooth
disarming intimacy about the tea-hour. The ceremony of
tea itself is so fine; it is elegant, aloof and gracious; it ministers
to taste yet not to appetite; people are not there to
chew and be nourished. And then the hour itself is lovable—the
sun’s rays growing level, dust in the air turned golden,
a hush perceptible even through the city’s noise. Stacey
surrendered to the atmosphere of intimacy. He drank the
fragrant China tea and talked without restraint of a number
of things. Perhaps, he thought, he and Marian might still
be friends. He had treated her abominably and was sorry
for it now that he understood her better, though she, he
admitted, understood him better than he her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could be silent, too. Pauses were not awkward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gather so much fineness together, Marian,” he remarked
once. “All that you touch becomes fine, turns to
gold.” He ceased abruptly. That was the wrong allusion,
he thought, annoyed at his clumsiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not seem to mind it. “You’re really quite
kindly toward me, aren’t you, Stacey?” she replied, with
perhaps just a hint of irony in her voice, but smiling
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t I be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No reason at all, of course,” she said prettily, making
him a mocking little bow. “Have some more tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out his cup, watched her fill it, then set it down
again, all mechanically. “People get in states of mind—for
no particular reason,” he said vaguely, feeling apologetic yet
not wanting to go into the matter—as much on her account
as on his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and then into others. Tell me:—do you feel kindly
toward everybody now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I shouldn’t go so far as to claim that!” he replied
uncomfortably. It went against his whole nature to talk
about himself to Marian, yet he felt he owed her some sort
of confession. So he went on haltingly. “I used to get
awfully worked up about a lot of things—about people
being greedy, for instance. I don’t mean any one person—everybody,
whole human race. But then,” he concluded diffidently,
“it struck me that they weren’t hateful on account
of it, but only pathetic, since their greed never brought them
happiness—never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian’s face was half turned away from him and she
was resting her chin in her cupped hand—an old familiar
pose—so that he could not see her expression. But all at
once she dropped her hand, lay back in her chair, and
laughed musically, startling him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Stacey, you’re so funny!” she exclaimed. “I’ve told
you that before. But I think,” she added, not laughing now,
smiling at him deliberately, “that I liked you better in your
fierce, world-defying, Byronic stage, when you were so
dramatic, than now in this Christ-like phase.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced sharply. She had really hurt him there. He
despised people who went sweetly through the world doing
good to others; which was what she meant. Stacey flushed
hotly. But he caught a fleeting gleam of triumph in
Marian’s eyes, and at this his anger and most of his shame
left him, and he only felt drearily that it was no use, she
hated him and had got him there on purpose to take this sort
of small revenge. It was true that she had led him on and
stabbed just when he had generously disarmed; she had not
played fair. But, after all, why should she?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She baffled him to-day, though. He thought that now he
was in for it, that she would try to lead him into some
further trap. Instead, she grew suddenly listless, talked
indifferently of casual things, or, again, talked rapidly and
artificially. She made no more onslaughts, was rather kind
to him than otherwise, ringing for the butler to bring up a
brand of cigarettes of which she knew Stacey was fond.
But he felt her to be immensely sophisticated, with no girlishness
remaining. Leaning back in her chair she had the
weary perfection of something finished, complete and soulless.
There was no trace left in her of the elfish charm for
which he had once loved her idolatrously. Nor had there
been at the very beginning of the afternoon when she had
seemed fresh and spontaneous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went down to the door with him when he left her, but
she shook hands almost apathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He puzzled over it as he walked homeward. He could not
understand what Marian had been about. Surely she had
not summoned him to give him that one thrust. She was too
clever not to have been able to do more than that if revenge
was what she had been after. It did not occur to him that
Marian might simply have been intolerably bored and have
wanted him as some kind of relief, to cajole or stab as the
mood struck her. What Stacey did feel was that it was
restful to go back to Catherine and his father from so much
futile complexity. Not that they were so limpid, either,
come to think about it; Catherine especially wasn’t. But
they were direct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interview left him feeling a little sore,—not altogether,
though partly, because he had been wounded in his
self-esteem. But this did not last; the matter was too trivial
to annoy him for long. He forgot all about it in his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just two weeks later at about four in the afternoon
when the door of Stacey’s office was thrown open and Ames
Price strode in. Stacey’s first feeling was one of surprise
and repressed amusement; for he had not seen Ames since
the evening of the outrageous jest played on him at the
road-house. Stacey’s second emotion, following immediately,
was a sick comprehending horror. It was as though
he had known everything beforehand in a dream that he had
forgotten and that had fought in vain to break loose and
summon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ames’s heavy face was set, in a struggle for self-control,
and his voice when he spoke was thick and difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with me, Carroll,” he stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had already sprung to his feet. He was paler than
Ames. “Yes,” he said, and snatched up his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other clenched his fists. “You mean to say—you
know already, damn you? Some one’s told you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Stacey dully, “no. Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slowly—through the office. No fuss. Got to smile.
Latimer said so.” It was as though Ames were reciting
a ritual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together they went down in the elevator and out of the
building. It was August, but the car that Ames had brought
was a closed car. “Latimer again,” thought Stacey, with a
touch of loathing beneath the horror that filled his mind.
They set off swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s—Marian,” said Ames. “She shot herself this morning.
Dying. She—asks for you.” He looked at Stacey—dully
rather than with hatred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was this, of course, or something like it, Stacey knew
already; but to hear it in words was abominable. A chill
ran over his body. He felt physically nauseated. He set
his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In—much—pain?” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car drove up beneath the porte-cochère of the Prices’
house, and the two men got out. They went upstairs together
silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Marian’s exquisite boudoir stood a black group of people.
Stacey recognized none of them at first, only caught a
feeling of their heavy incongruity in that place. Then he
saw that Mr. Latimer was one and that another was a doctor
whom he knew. There was a nurse also. From somewhere
Mrs. Latimer appeared, and Stacey perceived that she was a
haggard old woman. A look of relief softened her eyes a
very little at sight of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wants to see you, Stacey,” Mrs. Latimer murmured.
“I’ll speak to the doctor inside,” and she went through
a door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she returned with the doctor. “You can go in,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey pulled him aside a little way. “It won’t do any
harm?” he demanded hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no harm. Better to let her have her way. There’s
nothing to be done. The bullet missed the heart and penetrated
the lung instead. The wound is dressed. Be as calm
as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no hope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the faintest. She is—well, there’s no hope,” replied
the doctor, rather kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute, then,” said Stacey. He leaned against a
wall and struggled for composure. Then he wiped his forehead
with his handkerchief. “All right,” he said, and went
through the door with the doctor and Marian’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room beyond was hushed, cool and darkened. Mrs.
Latimer led Stacey to the bedside, then withdrew to a distant
corner of the room and stood there, motionless, with
the nurse and the doctor. When he looked that way he
could see them like dim figures in the background of some
faded Venetian picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that Stacey?” asked a thin voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he murmured, and knelt by the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian was propped up within it, and her face, that was
turned sideways toward him on the pillows, was like alabaster,
thin, veined and bloodless; but her beauty was unmarred,
heightened even—like a statue of her beauty. The
only color anywhere was in her bright hair that was spread
about the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you’ve come,” she said. “Take my hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did so, gently. Her voice was scarcely more than a
musical murmur, and between phrases she gasped for
breath. “Don’t talk!” he begged. “Let me talk to you,
Marian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, “I must talk to you, Stacey. Not much—only
a little.” She paused, panting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was wrenched with pain. This was unbearable.
His forehead was damp with sweat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted—to tell you,” she went on almost inaudibly,
“oh, lots of things! Not to worry—for one. It’s just—as
well. Only—isn’t it like me,” she said, with a faint smile,
“to fail—even in this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marian—please!” he muttered, tightening his hold on
her hand for an instant. It was the pathos of her frail
attempt at cynicism that shook him. For now she no longer
looked the weary, perfect, grown-up woman; she seemed a
little girl. To watch her die was like watching a child die—or
a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hurt you, Stacey. I—didn’t mean to,” she said softly,
and managed to stroke his hand, ever so faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was perhaps the first time he had found tenderness in
her. He set his teeth hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must say—what I have to—quickly,” she went on.
“You are not to—blame yourself, Stacey. You have—nothing—to—do—with—it.”
She paused for a moment, struggling
for breath. “I was—all wrong—twisted. You were
right. You couldn’t love me—or I you—not even you. I
could not bear—life—any longer—having made—such a
mess—of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She closed her eyes weakly, and he thought that she slept
or—had died. But presently they fluttered open again.
“I’m sorry,” she murmured, “that I said—what I did—to
you—the other day. It was not—true—and I did not mean
it—even then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he cried, in a choked voice, “don’t, Marian!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held his fingers close. “Poor Stacey!” she whispered.
“It’s not your fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she paused. And after a moment an elfish smile
stirred her lips. “Do I look—a fright?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s good!” she murmured, with the ghost of a
laugh. “Par—thenon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both silent for a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m sleepy. You may—go. But first—kiss me,
Stacey dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent over and touched her white cheek with his lips,
then rose slowly to his feet and made his way back unsteadily
to the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” he muttered hoarsely to the doctor.
“You’d better feel her pulse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor went quickly to the bed, then, after a moment,
returned. “Just the same—or only a little weaker. She’s
asleep,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey looked at Mrs. Latimer. “I’ll go, then. You’ll
keep me informed—by ’phone?” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded, taking his hand for an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned to the other room, dizzily. “She’s sleeping
just now,” he said to Marian’s husband. “Will you—have
your car take me—home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out into the hall together. Stacey stumbled,
and Ames grasped his arm and held it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Latimer had followed them. “Stacey,” he said,
“just a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey turned mechanically to stare at him. Up to now
he had only been vaguely aware of the man’s presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is perhaps unnecessary for me to warn you to say
nothing of this,” said Marian’s father stonily. “It must be
kept out of the papers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just what Stacey needed. He straightened up,
anger rushing through him like a hot flood. “Go to hell!”
he said, then swung about and walked quickly and firmly
downstairs, with Ames following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door of the car the two men gazed at each other
helplessly. There was no antagonism between them now.
In some odd way they were even united.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you said that to Latimer,” Ames remarked
dully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So was Stacey glad. His anger was all that sustained
him on the ride home. For he felt that everything was Mr.
Latimer’s fault. All the worst of Marian <span class='it'>he</span> had given her.
Almost he had pointed the revolver.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey let himself in with a latch-key, then hurried up
the stairs to his own rooms. Once in his study, he threw
himself down upon a couch and lay there for a long time,
motionless, his hands thrown back and clasped beneath his
head. But there was no relaxation in his stillness. His
body was tense, and now and then a spasm contracted the
taut muscles of his face. The late western sunlight poured
in through the windows and flickered brightly across the
wall, and the shrill distant voices of children at play were
audible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Stacey turned his head slowly to look at a small
travelling clock on a stand near the couch. The hands
pointed to six-thirty. He got up with an effort, pressed the
button of a bell, then sat down at his desk, rested his head
in his hands, and stared blindly out of the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Mrs. Blair is in,” he said, without moving, when
Parker entered the room, “please ask her if she will be so
kind as to come up here for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said the man, and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Catherine tapped at the door, and Stacey rose
wearily. “Come in!” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked fresh and very young to him who felt so old.
“You wanted to see me?” she began, then broke off to gaze
at him in alarm. “Stacey!” she cried, “what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catherine,” he said in a monotonous voice, “do me a
favor, please. Tell my father I won’t be down to dinner—and
why. Marian Latimer shot herself this morning. She
is dying. I have just been there. It has rather knocked me
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had turned pale, and her eyes were wide with
horror. “Oh!” she gasped, then suddenly went closer to
him. “Stacey,” she said gently, “sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obeyed and resumed his former pose, staring again
out of the window. “Don’t let the servants hear what you
say,” he went on, in the same dead tone. “It’s to be kept
secret. And don’t let father come up to see me. He would
be kind, but I can’t see him now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew in her breath sharply, but said nothing,—only
laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this he swung about, as though the touch had loosened
something within him. “It’s the ghastly—waste
that gets me—so hard!” he cried, his face set with
pain. “Death itself—that’s nothing! An episode! But
to see so much loveliness, so much fineness, all go
wrong—obliquely—to futile death as to—a climax! It’s
unbearable!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey! Stacey!” Catherine whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s all my fault—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No! you mustn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But yes! My fault! If I could only have gone on loving
her, or if, not loving her, I had married her, things might
have been different. Not so—complete a mess! We’d have
become adjusted—somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine drew up a chair swiftly and sat down close to
him. “Stacey,” she cried unsteadily, her eyes shining with
tears, “I beg of you—you mustn’t! The truth is bad
enough,—ah, please don’t go beyond the truth! It was not
your fault—only in as much as what happens to any one
in the whole world is one’s fault. Poor lovely Marian!—there
was something—I don’t know—something twisted in
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this and at the soft compassion of her voice Stacey
looked toward Catherine differently. “Twisted—it was
what she called herself only half an hour ago,” he said in a
gentler tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were silent for a time. Something in the young
woman’s clear presence comforted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She looked like a little girl, Catherine,” he said at last,
only sorrowfully. “You would not have known her. And
so beautiful! Oh, wicked!” Again his face contracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, indeed, though he did not see it at the moment, as
poignant an emotion for him as any in all the tragedy lay
in the destruction of so much sheer beauty. Afterward,
weeks afterward, he perceived this, and recognized with
pain that Marian herself had understood it, even tenderly
at the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell of the telephone on Stacey’s desk rang, and he
reached slowly for the receiver. Catherine gazed at him
apprehensively, but he spoke quietly enough, just a few
words, in reply to the message, then hung up the receiver
and turned to Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is dead,” he murmured. “She died in her sleep.
She never waked after I left her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to say. The two sat there in silence
for some minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must go down, Catherine,” Stacey said finally. “It
is almost seven. Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose reluctantly. “You’ll let me have something sent
up to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No! I can’t eat!” he exclaimed with revulsion. “I
have to think,” he added, “of what to say to Mrs. Latimer.
I must go to see her after a while. What <span class='it'>can</span> I say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine gave him a look in which there was something
like pride. But all that she answered was that he must eat
something; then went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat there, reflecting painfully. He felt tired, hopeless,
alive in a dead empty world, but he was less tense now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while—in half an hour, perhaps—the door opened
and Catherine herself came in with a tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled faintly at this. “You will have your way,
won’t you?” he remarked; but he ate a little while she sat
watching him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey,” she asked diffidently, when he had finished,
“should you like me to go with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Mrs. Latimer’s?” he exclaimed. “Oh, would you?
But no,” he added impatiently, “why should I lay things on
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t be doing that. If I could, perhaps, share a
little, I should be glad. You’ve had—nearly enough, I
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re kind,” he said gruffly. “All right. Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll go for a wrap and come back at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” he said, with a start, when she returned, “I must
order the car brought around.” And he reached for the
telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s at the door,” she replied simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when they went down the stairs they met nobody
either there or in the hall. That, too, was Catherine’s
work, he thought with a softening touch of gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat silent during the ride, trying to think what he
should say to Mrs. Latimer. But he could find nothing;
he could only trust to the moment. It was a horrible task.
Yet he was not undertaking it as a duty; he was going only
because he was overwhelmingly sorry for his old friend
and concerned about her. At any rate, Catherine’s quiet
presence was of some help. He felt her as not weak in her
compassion but strong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It demanded a real effort for him to ring the bell of the
Latimers’ house, but he did so, and after a little while a
maid opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Mrs. Latimer got back yet?” Stacey asked in a
low tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, but—she said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. That she could not see any one. But she will
want to see me, I think. Just let me go quietly in. She
is in the drawing-room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,—with Mr. Latimer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey winced. This made it harder. But he went quietly
through the hall and into the familiar room; and Catherine
followed him, a step or two behind. Just across the
threshold he paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only a single shaded reading-lamp was burning, and that
at the farthest corner of the long room; so that the part
nearest Stacey was all in darkness. At first the only person
in the room appeared to be Mr. Latimer, who, his hands
clasped behind his back, was pacing up and down across
the far end of it, from lamp to window and from window
to lamp. When he approached the lamp and turned, his
face was illuminated from below, so that the chin and the
delicate selfish mouth showed clearly, while the eyes and
forehead remained shadowy. Stacey could not conquer his
feeling of bitter hardness. The man was suffering, no doubt,
in his own way, but he was not generous enough—so Stacey
thought—to suffer deeply. He looked proud even now,
when it was no time for pride; he should have been comforting
his wife. And what had he done? What had he done?
Could he not understand?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey gave him only a moment of thought. His
eyes were searching the room for Mrs. Latimer. And presently
he found her—a wrecked huddled figure on a couch
just opposite him. Her face was hidden among the cushions;
only her hair, her dark dress, and one clenched hand
were visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey took a step forward. “Mrs. Latimer,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat up with a gasp; but it was her husband who spoke.
“Who is there?” he called sharply, pausing and gazing
toward Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Stacey Carroll, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Latimer stiffened. “This is no time for you to come
to this house,” he said coldly. “You should know that. I
do not wish to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Stacey replied. “But I came to see Mrs. Latimer—unless
she would prefer not to have me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman on the couch leaned forward. “Oh, yes,
Stacey!” she cried, in a tone that went to his heart. He
was sure of himself now; he was indifferent to what Mr.
Latimer might say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man stood there, erect in the lamplight, handsome,
implacable, but to Stacey non-existent. “Either you
or I, Carroll, must leave this house,” he said haughtily.
“Both of us—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this Mrs. Latimer had sprung to her feet, tottering
a little. “Then,” she cried, in a tense voice that told
Stacey much, “it must be you, Herbert! <span class='it'>I</span> wish to see
Stacey. Oh,” she murmured weakly, but with relief, “and
Catherine—you’ve come! How—good!” And she sank
down again upon the couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Stacey moved toward her he, too, for a moment
thought of Catherine. He knew well how shy, how retiring,
even how shrinking she was by nature; yet all through this
brief unpleasant scene he had felt her standing there, gently
strong, not wincing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Latimer said only: “As you please,” and left
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey knelt on the rug before the couch, but, though
Mrs. Latimer touched his hair tremblingly and had sent
away her husband to have him there, it was to Catherine
that she turned, clasping her hand and making the young
woman sit down close beside her on the divan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The half-hour that followed was atrocious, worse than
anything Stacey had ever been through. For he had seen
bodies shockingly tortured and minds driven to madness
by pain and terror, but this was the destruction of a noble
personality, of a character built up bravely through long
effort; it was the negation of everything. And the worst
of it was that in the broken phrases that Mrs. Latimer cried
out—sometimes to him, mostly to Catherine—traces remained
of her high, clear, unified intelligence, like drifting
debris of a wrecked ship. “My little girl! My poor baby!”
she broke out once. “A child again only when—dying!
Wasted—wasted—all for nothing, a whole life! Oh, it’s my
fault!—no, his! <span class='it'>his! his!</span>” (this with a terrible fierceness).
“No, mine, too! mine, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were pauses of exhaustion between her outbursts,
and after a while she grew slightly calmer, merely
clinging to Catherine, who spoke little, but in a tone of infinite
tenderness. Beneath everything else Stacey felt an
awe of Catherine for her deep calm that expressed the
very opposite of indifference. As for himself, he could find
nothing to do (which was perhaps as well) save once to
slip out into the hall and telephone the doctor whom he had
seen at Marian’s bedside, to say that he must come with
something to put Mrs. Latimer to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I make you some chocolate, dear, you will drink it,
will you not?” asked Catherine at last, pleadingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you wish,” Mrs. Latimer answered, worn out and
quieted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she kept the young woman’s hand tight clasped in
hers, so that Catherine looked up at Stacey for a moment
with a faint questioning smile. For the first time tears
started to his eyes; there was so much of selfless weary
beauty in the look she gave him. He nodded, went
quickly out to the kitchen, found the scared cook, and presently
himself brought in the chocolate, which Mrs. Latimer
drank with trembling gulps, Catherine holding the cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the doctor came and with Catherine’s help put Mrs.
Latimer to bed, while Stacey waited below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Catherine came down again and they went out
to the car. Her face looked tired and drawn. The strain
had been horrible. Stacey himself, who had perforce borne
so small a share of it, was ready to drop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said almost timidly after a moment.
“I’m sorry not to have been able to do more. It wasn’t
fair to you. You did so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” she exclaimed, but she was resting her head against
the upholstered back of the seat. “Poor lady!” she murmured
then. “So pitifully—broken! It wasn’t only—herself
that Marian hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose it ever is,” said Stacey wearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine gave him a look of sympathy. “Can you sleep,
do you think?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this he sat erect. “I refuse to have you bother
your head about me too,” he said sharply. “Yes, I know
I can sleep.”</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Latimer and the others interested succeeded in keeping
the truth hidden. Officially, even according to the account
given by the sensational evening paper, the death was
an accident—there had been burglaries, the times were unsafe,
there was a wave of crime in Vernon, Marian had
been placing a revolver in the drawer of her desk, and all
the rest of it. Privately no one believed the story, and the
various things that people did believe were too wild to deserve
mention. But officially every one believed it. Officially
every one in Vernon always believed what he should.
This was Vernon’s great strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey did not recover easily from the shock. Perhaps
it even worked some permanent change in him. For it left
him bruised, saddened, yet somehow calmer and cooler. He
worked tremendously at the office, and in the days immediately
following the tragedy did indeed value his work mostly
as a means to temporary forgetfulness. He saw but few
people, and only two or three of these willingly, for he
found it hard to talk. He was glad enough to see Edwards
now and then at the luncheon hour—at least after their
first meeting, when, to excuse the manner he simply could
not help, Stacey felt obliged to tell him, who came from an
outside world, that Marian Price had been an old friend
and that he was pretty cut up by her death; which was hard.
Yet Edwards’ gruff awkward expression of sympathy was
not unpleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s memory of Marian was as of something delicate,
lovely and frustrated, and it was softened by that final unwonted
touch of tenderness she had shown; but he could
never quite forgive Marian what she had done to her mother.
In this she had been her father’s daughter. Callous toward
others, the Latimers! Hard, at bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went as often as he could to see Mrs. Latimer, or
took her out with him into the park. She recovered from
the terrible prostration of that first night, even quickly; she
regained an adequate composure of manner; and her sensitive
receptive mind was intact. She had always had the
faculty of true intuition, which is (as opposed to the false
intuition that means merely guessing) the faculty of thinking
so swiftly that the logical steps along the way are barely
brushed by the flying thought, and the conclusion is so
quickly reached that to the breathless beholder it appears to
have been attained at one leap. This faculty she did not
lose. But in her own attitude toward the world she was
sadly changed, no longer a strong flexible personality armed
with a gentle irony, giving more than she took, unafraid of
facts; she had become a weak shaken woman, with no shelter
for her sensitive soul. Almost terrified she seemed at
times. And it was Stacey who now tried to give her the
support she had formerly tried to give him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He noted one peculiarity that seemed rather horrible to
him. For at least two months after Marian’s death Mrs.
Latimer could not see her husband enter a room where she
was without giving a shudder of revulsion at his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing of good Stacey had gained from the tragedy.
He knew Catherine now. Not entirely, by any means; but
it was as though he had found a key to the locked door of
her personality, and had opened the door and stepped inside
just a little way. The intense shyness that wrapped her
about had nothing to do with self-consciousness; he had always
known that. Now he began to understand that the
noble quality of her self lay in her very selflessness. She
barely thought of herself consciously at all; and thus to
have others do so disturbed her. She gave and gave and
took nothing. It was through her immense capacity for
pity—not a pity whimpering weakly over a wretched world,
but a strong useful pity—that one got to know her. She had
given so much of her selflessness to Stacey at the time of
the catastrophe that she had given of herself, too; she could
not now take back what she had given, even if she wished
to do so. He was shocked and numbed by what had happened,
and she continued instinctively to give him all the
quiet lavish help she could. She was giving perhaps more
than she knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day she even brought him one of the articles she had
written for a London weekly. She was humble about it,
but at heart he was even humbler; for, simply worded, with
no pretence at decoration, a brief, clearly stated apology for
the “Let-us-eat-drink-and-be-merry” attitude of the day, it
radiated a gentle warmth of feeling. Afterward she showed
Stacey other articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Generally he trod very carefully, taking pains to say nothing
that might drive this half-held prodigal friend back behind
shadowy barriers of reserve. But one Sunday afternoon
in October, when they had gone for a walk in the
country, and the boys up ahead were plunging deliriously
through heaps of dead leaves, he suddenly turned on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catherine,” he said, “you give so much—always! But
you cannot be all selflessness. There must be a hidden self
in you that could take a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a startled look and did not speak. It was
as though she had retreated to a great distance. Still she
was there. He had thought she might vanish utterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s a kind of shy maiden-self that you neglect,”
he added. “You know next to nothing about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she murmured, “I do take!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was astonished and remorseful to perceive that her
lips were trembling and her eyes moist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I shock you, Catherine?” he exclaimed. “Silly meddler
I am! I’ve no business to bother you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” she returned, “it’s not that! It’s only that
you’re so kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I!” he cried in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, and then suddenly smiled at his
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he remarked helplessly, “if prying into your
thoughts can be called kindness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The kindness is in what you do it for,” she said quietly,
and they came up with the boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was far closer than he had ever approached her before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s intimacy with his father, too, was closer since
the tragedy. Mr. Carroll could hardly be expected to understand
the strange relationship that had held Marian and
Stacey together and apart; he did not even have the necessary
facts to go on. But he saw with all his direct clearness
the effect of Marian’s sudden death on his son, and was very
kind, and tactful as well. He even took obvious pains to
avoid discussion of subjects—such as Bolshevism, labor and
the Republican Party—on which he perhaps fancied his son
did not at heart agree with him. This touched Stacey, but
was quite unnecessary. Stacey had no more interest in
Bolshevism or the other things than in the Mabinogion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In November a strike of the street-railway employees broke
out. The company, which had applied for and obtained a
seven-cent fare six months earlier, had now asked for the
right to raise it to ten cents. The city council refused;
whereupon the company, alleging its inability to carry on
at even a modest profit under the existing costs, declared a
twenty per cent. cut in wages, and the employees struck.
The clash was fierce and there was much violence.
The company imported strike-breakers from Chicago, they
were mobbed, there were deaths, the militia was called out,
and a few empty cars with shattered windows ran occasionally
up and down the city streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was not particularly interested, having other
things to think about. He barely glanced at the news headlines
and smiled ironically as he did so, knowing that Colin
Jeffries, who had a controlling interest in the stock of the
street-railway company, also virtually owned the evening
(Republican) paper and was engaged in many business
enterprises with the owner of the morning (Democratic)
paper. As for the editorials, he would no more have read
them than he would have read the latest novel by Harold
Bell Wright. But sometimes his father read them aloud at
table in a tone of fierce assent, and thus Stacey learned that
they were all about “one hundred per cent. Americanism”
and the duty of labor to yield something, just as capital was
yielding something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, one afternoon Edwards, whom Stacey had not
seen for a week, suddenly entered the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” cried Stacey cordially. “Come in. Where have
you been?”—then broke off at sight of the other’s
appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards was unshaven and rather dirty, and his eyes
glowed darkly in his tense face. He shut the door behind
him, then sat down opposite Stacey at the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to talk to you, Carroll,” he said. “It’s about
the strike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Stacey. “I hardly know anything about
it, haven’t followed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards’ eyes suddenly blazed. “No,” he cried, “of
course not! What’s it all matter to <span class='it'>you</span>? <span class='it'>You’re</span> all right!
<span class='it'>You’re</span> not your brother’s keeper! It—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now look here,” said Stacey, firmly but pleasantly
enough, “cut out the class business, will you? You know
that’s not the way you feel about me or you wouldn’t be
coming here to see me. I haven’t a doubt but that the men
are right in this strike, but the reason I’ve kept off the subject
as much as possible is because I don’t see what in the
world I can do about it, and I don’t know anything worse
than futile sentimental sympathy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I apologize, Carroll,” Edwards returned moodily. “I
didn’t mean that, of course. And I’d probably better apologize
in advance for anything else I may break loose and
say. I haven’t had much sleep lately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” Stacey replied. “Go as far as you
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carroll,” said Edwards painfully, “we’re beaten. I
mean, on every big thing. There isn’t going to be any
change in the rotten system, not for now. There isn’t going
to be any revolution. There isn’t going to be a beginning of
socialism, all men sharing tasks, each according to his
capacity. There’s just going to be the same tyranny there’s
always been, the same exploitation of a lot of men by a few.
I tell you, I’m broken-hearted!” He paused, his face set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be,” said Stacey, “if you hoped for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I did and I didn’t! I thought maybe—but now this
strike,” he went on sharply. “Six months ago there’d have
been a general strike in sympathy. Every workman in the
city would have downed tools. Not—now! We’re beaten,
I tell you! There are thousands of unemployed, winter’s
here, coal costs what you know, the men don’t dare.
Beaten! You’ve heard what one of the big employers said
openly—that pretty soon the men would be eating out of
their hands! And here am I fighting for this puny little
thing—that men be doled out enough to exist on! And fighting
in vain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey looked at him with silent sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here!” said Edwards, tearing papers from his pocket.
“Here are the figures. Here’s what it costs a family of
three to live—Government statistics. Here’s what the men
were getting. Here’s what they’re to get now if they yield.”
He pushed the papers across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey fingered them, but kept his eyes on his friend. “I
know,” he said. “I can imagine without studying them.
What do you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Edwards nervously. “I’d thought of
two or three things. If you were to print the facts—just
the facts—with your name signed to them, in one of the
papers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled bitterly. “Fat chance! How much of a
power in this town do you think I am? Don’t you know that
Colin Jeffries, who owns the street-railway, controls the
papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know that, damn him!” Edwards burst out. “He’s
everywhere! You can’t get out from under his shadow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And even if I could get such an article printed, what
would it accomplish? When did the public ever budge?
Inert mass of sheep! And all the time the papers harping
on the idea that the street-railway company can’t pay its
stock-holders even a nominal interest on their investment
under current conditions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Edwards fairly shouted, “and if they can’t! Do
you know anything about that company? I do. I’ve looked
into it with a lawyer. Way over-capitalized. Three millions
of water, Carroll,—three cool millions into private
pockets! So men must starve, must they, to pay interest
on that stock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey’s face was grim. “No,” he said shortly, “I hadn’t
looked into it, but it doesn’t surprise me. I’ll tell you what I
<span class='it'>could</span> do,” he said hesitatingly after a moment. “I—er—the
only available income I have is what I make here at the
office. I could turn over—say two hundred and fifty dollars
a month of it to the union. And I might—that is, I don’t
know what my sister does with her income—gives most of
it away, I fancy—but I dare say she’d put in as much more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards stared. “Say,” he said shakily, “that’s decent!
I thought you had—well, it’s none of my business. But it
wouldn’t be any use, Carroll. Not a hundredth part enough.
But—thanks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Stacey deprecatingly, then fell to thinking.
“Look here,” he remarked finally, “there’s only one thing
I can think of, and it will have to be you to do it rather than
I. Also it’s only a faint chance. Now my father is an
honest man—set in his beliefs, but honest. And he’s also
influential. Colin Jeffries probably defers as much to him
as to any one living, because father’s very likely the only
thoroughly honest, disinterested friend Jeffries has. Father
believes in the principles Jeffries only exploits to make
money out of. If you can get him—my father, I mean—on
your side, he might take the matter up to Jeffries
personally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards’ face expressed extreme dislike of the suggestion.
“Can’t say I care much for the idea—like begging for
what you’ve a right to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t suppose you would. But I estimate that what
you’re out for is to save a living wage for these men—by
any means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Edwards muttered, “I’d do anything. But how on
earth could I swing your father into line?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Stacey slowly, “come out to the house this
evening at eight-fifteen, just when dinner’s over, and talk
to him, always about the personal side, the facts of it, show
him the figures, <span class='it'>and keep away from all discussion of principles</span>!
Appeal to his sense of fair play to get him to go
down with you to-morrow morning and see the men
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards reflected. “All right,” he said sullenly, and rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind now!” Stacey called after him, “no principles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey made himself very agreeable at dinner that evening.
He was keyed up by anticipation, his eyes glowed, and
he looked younger. There was an added warmth in the
harmony that had been lately achieved in the Carroll house.
But Stacey saw Catherine glance at him wonderingly. It
wasn’t possible to hide feelings from Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught her alone for a moment on the way to the
library. “Now listen!” he said. “You stick by me. Don’t
budge from the library. And support me in every way
you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her dark eyes were curious, but her lips curved faintly
into a smile—perhaps at his tone of command, that was so
unlike his customary tone with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would explain nothing, however; only marched her
on down the hall. And a very few minutes later Parker
came in to say that a Mr. Edwards had called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” Stacey exclaimed, “he’s a friend of mine!
Bring him in, Parker,—or, no, I’ll go get him myself,” and
he went out. “Take it easy now, and no principles,” he
growled to Edwards, as he piloted him in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” Stacey remarked, “this is my friend, Edwards,—was
commander of the Legion post, you know. Mrs.
Blair, Mr. Edwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, sir?” said Mr. Carroll, shaking hands.
His face had assumed its keen yet non-committal business-look.
Mr. Carroll knew something about Edwards, of
course, and disapproved of what he knew, but he was a
courteous gentleman in his own house; such a man as Mr.
Latimer, artistically conscious of every attitude, could not
have expressed the situation more nicely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to say a few words to you, sir, about this
strike,” Edwards began, sitting down awkwardly in the
chair toward which Stacey had impelled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll did not reply at once. He gnawed at his
moustache, his eyes grew harder, and he shot one swift
angry glance at Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to now Stacey had been rather pleased with himself;
he thought he had engineered things well. It suddenly
struck him that, instead, he had made a mess of them. His
father was angry with him, and therefore more hostile to
Edwards. And Edwards was nowhere near at his best;
he was gauche, heavy, impressed by his surroundings—it
had never occurred to Stacey that he might be,—and correspondingly
resentful. Oh, Lord! Stacey looked across
helplessly at Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had poured out another cup of coffee and now handed
it to the guest. “Will you have sugar, Mr. Edwards?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no, thank you!” he replied, startled, and took the
cup gingerly. He looked as though he would much rather
have refused it had he dared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll turned his eyes back to the young man. “I
have no connection with the street-railway company, Mr.
Edwards,” he said deliberately, choosing his words with
care. “On the basis of such information as I have been
able to obtain in regard to the strike my sympathies are with
the company. I fail to see why capital should have to make
all the sacrifices and labor none. But since you—<span class='it'>and Stacey</span>—wish
it, I shall be glad to hear you state the men’s side of
the case. I should think, however, that some official of the
street-railway company would be the proper person to
hear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards, who had flushed, made a quick angry gesture.
But this almost upset the fragile cup that he held; so he
was forced into restraint. He drank his coffee hastily before
replying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir,” he began then, “Carroll—I mean Stacey—thought
if I could give you the facts as I did to him you’d
maybe see them our way. I don’t want to talk about principles,
sir—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards glanced wrathfully at Stacey. “Because we
wouldn’t agree about them and there wouldn’t be any use in
our trying to.” His hand trembled slightly, and the tiny
silver spoon rattled against his coffee cup; so he rose and
limped over to a table to rid himself of the nuisance once
for all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine leaned forward. “Stacey told me you had been
wounded in the war, Mr. Edwards,” she said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked toward her. “Yes, ma’am,” he returned, “at
Les Eparges. My right leg was rather shot to bits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey drew a breath of relief. He hardly thought Catherine
was being deliberately tactful; she had spoken impulsively.
But the result was excellent. And Edwards in the
tone with which he replied to Catherine revealed that old-fashioned
attitude of deference toward women just as
women, which was also Mr. Carroll’s attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope they fixed you up all right,” said Mr. Carroll
gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty well, thanks. I happened to draw a good
surgeon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Stacey, he said nothing at all. He had that much
sense anyway, he told himself. He’d have to face his father
later on; for the present he wanted to be as nearly forgotten
as possible. So he sat still and commented silently on the
shifting fortunes of the battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a cigar, Edwards?” asked Mr. Carroll, holding out
his case. (Good! There was a touch of something more
personal in this.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you, sir.” (Oh, confound it! why didn’t he
take one?).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards drew his papers from his pocket. “Mr. Carroll,”
he said, “I’m not going to talk to you at all about social
theories or about what sort of stock it is that the street-railway
company wants to pay dividends on.” (“Well,
damn it, then, don’t!” cried Stacey internally.) “I only
want to show you, in figures, the condition of the employees
just as men; what they were getting, what they’re going to
get if they accept this cut in wages, what it costs a family
of three to live to-day.” And he began to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not read aloud very well. He stuttered a little
over a word now and then. But there was an intensity in
his deep voice that lent an odd warmth to the figures about
groceries, fuel, wages, and the rest. Mr. Carroll must see
that the man was in deadly earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had finished reading he stretched out the papers.
“Want to see them?” he demanded abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll shook his head. He was frowning and chewing
at the end of his cigar. “The trouble is,” he began, but
with less than his usual firmness, “that you can’t separate
facts from principles. Labor—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” cried Catherine suddenly, “you must!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of the three men started and turned toward her;
Stacey had been looking at her already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Catherine’s eyes were fixed now on the guest. “Do
you mean, Mr. Edwards,” she asked, in a voice that revealed
both compassion and scorn, “that the highest wage of any
employee would be only forty cents an hour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am,” said Edwards bitterly, “if they accept the
cut in wages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are there many families of three?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most are a good deal more than three,” he replied.
“About twenty per cent. of the men are unmarried and perhaps
bring the average down to three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s face had an odd expression. Stacey thought
she looked like a sorrowful goddess. “Before my husband
died,” she said, “we were a family of four. We were living
on two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and you thought,
Mr. Carroll, that we had to live too sordidly. You will do
something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed at her kindly, but did not reply at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was touched by the mention of Phil. The thought
of Phil was with him, almost like a gentle presence, very
often. Catherine spoke of him seldom but, when she did
so, quite simply and naturally, as now. She must miss him
sadly, Stacey thought, and felt grieved for her. But, since
it was his instinct to carry through unswervingly anything
he had undertaken, he was also exultant, as well as faintly
amused at his father, who was being swept away from
principles at every turn, simply not permitted to play
with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say I like those statistics,” said Mr. Carroll at
last, more to Catherine than to Edwards. Then he turned
to the latter. “But I’d have to know more. I’d have to
look into things. And then I don’t know what I could do
about it; I might do something, I suppose. Confound it!
sir,” he exclaimed impatiently, “why didn’t you take this up
with some official of the company?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to know more, sir,” Edwards returned
eagerly. “I’d like it if you’d go down with me and see some
of the strikers man to man, get their story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll reflected, frowning. “All right,” he said
sharply. “Come to my office to-morrow morning at nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s face fairly shone, and Mr. Carroll, looking
back at her, relaxed his sternness and leaned over to pat
her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I go, too?” she asked of them both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>ma’am</span>!” said Edwards, getting up. “I’d like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made his adieux clumsily, with too much formality,
and Stacey accompanied him down the hall to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Edwards remarked, “that’s something, I suppose,—thanks
to Mrs. Blair. Precious little help you were,
though, Carroll!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Stacey cheerfully, “I messed things up
properly. But then, look at you! What the devil do you
mean by behaving like a resentful commoner at a court
function? Go on home, you sulky snob!” he added with a
laugh, and pushed his friend out of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he returned to the library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father and Catherine were sitting there in silence, she
gazing away with dark abstracted eyes, he frowning slightly
and staring down at a closed magazine on which he tapped
nervously with his fingers. He looked up and turned to
Catherine as Stacey entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You a member of this conspiracy, Catherine?” he
asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Stacey exclaimed promptly, “she wasn’t! Didn’t
know a thing about it. It was all my damfoolishness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Mr. Carroll, and rose. “I’ll go to bed, I
think. Good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stacey set his back against the door. “No, sir,” he
returned, “let’s have this out. I’ll concede that I was wrong
to do this in this way. Now you go ahead and tell me some
more things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father stood there, looking at him keenly, antagonistically,
judging him. Mr. Carroll’s upper lip was drawn
in a little, and there was a harshness about his face. One
could see that he had fought hard fights in life and that he
was still an adversary to be reckoned with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not aware,” he began coldly, “of being in my dotage—yet.
If anybody wants anything from me the thing for
him to do is to come and ask me for it; then if I think he
ought to have it he’ll get it. I’ll be damned if I’ll be cosseted
and cajoled into a good humor so that something can
be wormed out of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Absolutely justified, his father was, Stacey thought helplessly.
“You’re perfectly right, sir,” he said, “and I apologize,
My only excuse for not being frank—and I admit it’s
not good enough—is that I was so confoundedly anxious
for you to hear Edwards’ story, and was fool enough to
think you might refuse if I asked you to, point-blank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For just an instant Stacey glanced away to Catherine and
saw with sharp regret that her eyes were full of pain. Why
the devil had he let her in for this? Then he looked back
at his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Carroll’s wrath was not assuaged, and when he
spoke again Stacey perceived that a long resentment, dangerously
repressed, had burst loose finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take me for a damned fool,” Mr. Carroll went on
angrily. “I’m a fool perhaps, but not a damned fool. Do
you think I can’t see how you humor me?—the nice, kindly,
tolerant spirit you show for my foibles, your ‘poor-dad-he’s-growing-old’
attitude! Superior, sir! Intolerably superior!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was pretty bad, and all the worse for the tiny element
of truth it contained. “Now look here, dad!” Stacey
pleaded. “That’s not so. There isn’t anybody in the world
I respect more than I do you. Why—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extraordinary method of showing it you take, then!”
snapped his father. “Respect—nothing! At heart you’re a
Bolshevist, sir. Well, then, if you are, <span class='it'>be</span> one! You’re not
consistent. You’re a Bolshevist in theory” (“Oh, Lord! I
haven’t got any theories!” Stacey thought, but did not try
to say), “a millionaire in practice. I gave you a tidy fortune.
You took it, didn’t you? You live here with me in a
certain amount of luxury. Well, why do you? Why don’t
you go and live in a hut?” He paused, out of breath,
glaring at his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was pale; for this hurt. But he was further than
before from losing his temper, since now the attack was
unjust. To his amazement, and certainly to Mr. Carroll’s
as well, it was Catherine who lost her temper—or almost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Carroll!” she cried—and both men, turning suddenly
toward her, saw her standing erect, a slim firm figure with a
face of angry beauty. “That’s unfair and cruel and not like
you! I know that Stacey cares less for money than any one
else in Vernon—and it is a shame that it should have to be
I to say so. He lived for four years in mud and horror
because he hoped it would do some good. It’s wonderful
that when he came back and seemed to find that it hadn’t
done any good he could keep his sanity. And still he’d go
and live like that again if it were of any use. And you accuse
him of living here because of the luxuries you give him!
He lives here because of his affection for you and because
of the affection he thought you had for him. It’s—shameful—what
you said!” She ceased and sat down again, her
breath coming fast, her lips quivering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey gazed at her, his heart beating rather quickly; he
was overwhelmed with the number of his emotions. He was
astounded at the brave magnificent way she had spoken,
proud that it was in his cause, deeply touched, and somehow
profoundly sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Mr. Carroll, he looked in a dazed way from Catherine
to his son. “There is no excuse for what I—said to
you, son,” he said at last. “I don’t suppose you can forgive
me. Try to, if you are able.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey walked over and shook his hand. “Oh—er—shucks,
dad!” he muttered. “It’s all right—forgotten.” It
was the first time he had ever heard his father apologize
to any one for anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll gave his son a strange wistful look of gratitude,
then went over to Catherine. “Are you going to let
me sit down beside you, Catherine?” he asked. “You’re
not going to pack up and leave the house just because your
host’s an old fool?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said in a strangled voice, giving him her hand,
but keeping her face averted, so that neither he nor Stacey
could see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not altogether an old fool, my dear,” he added, patting
her hand; then got up again. “Er—a game of pinochle,
Stacey?” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey nodded, and moved to get the card table. “Sure!
I’d like one. But you don’t really think you’ve any chance
against me, do you, dad?” he said shakily.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At breakfast next morning no allusion was made to the
promised excursion with Edwards, but Stacey was confident
of its success. On this account, as well as on others, he was
glad of last night’s storm. For he knew his father. Mr.
Carroll might fancy that principles were the foundation of
his life; they were not, they were mere dead wood. First
and last it was by personal relationships that he was swayed.
It was this that gave him his sweetness, his directness, his
genius for holding friends, his absolute inability to be impartial.
He would have made a very poor judge. As a result
of the quarrel he would be unavoidably on Edwards’ side—because
it was Stacey’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll was nearly always gay at breakfast; on this
morning he was delightful. But he did not tease Catherine,
as he often tried to do. Instead, he joked with the boys,
with great detriment to their table manners, and reduced
Jackie in particular to a condition that shocked even Carter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Catherine, she seemed to Stacey shyer than usual,
more withdrawn. This was natural, he thought. After
that splendid outburst in defence of him she must of course
retreat hurriedly into herself. Which was rather obtuse
of Stacey, since he should surely have known by now that
for Catherine giving was not logically followed by taking
back, but by further giving. At any rate, despite her silence,
he felt a closeness to her, a deep intimacy with her. There
was a touch of melancholy at his heart, too; for he felt more
than he cared to admit. He did not venture to speak much
to Catherine—only a few matter-of-fact words. Ah, well,
last evening’s scene had temporarily stripped off too many
discreet veils, left emotions too naked; by to-night everything
would have become normal again. Yet Stacey did not
precisely envisage this certainty with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He motored into town with his father and Catherine, but
left them at the door of the Carroll Building and went on
to his own office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He worked that morning with less complete absorption
than usual, and at half past twelve went to the lunch-room,
hoping to find Edwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards was not there, but before Stacey had finished
eating he came in, looking radiant. “It’s all right, Carroll,”
he said gaily, limping over with a sandwich and coffee.
“Your father saw things our way. There’s something pretty
fine about him. You can’t help liking him. And then Mrs.
Blair, well, she’s just a wonder—the real thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was rather calmer. “What did father say he’d
do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he was non-committal, of course! Said he didn’t
know whether he could do anything, but he’d try. Remarked
that Colin Jeffries was a fair man, one of the fairest
he knew, also a great citizen! And I was a lamb, Carroll,
swallowed that without even a gulp! So it’s pretty clear
he’s gone to take the thing up with Jeffries—or will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey considered his friend curiously. Extraordinary,
this thinking in classes! Edwards did not think of capitalists
as men; he thought of them as parts of a whole, which
was capital. It was only capital he thought about really, as
something with an existence of its own. So he took it for
granted that if you swung over one capitalist to your side
you could swing the whole, just as when you pulled back the
lever of an engine you set the entire machine in motion.
Neat, very,—but not true. Stacey himself, though he had
suggested the scheme, was far from confident that his father
could bring Colin Jeffries around, because Stacey saw the
problem as a personal problem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said soberly, “I hope father can pull it off.
Come on up to the office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat in Stacey’s room and smoked silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Blair is a corker!” Edwards announced suddenly.
“The best ever! Do you raise many like her in your caste?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey smiled. “Not so you’d notice it,” he returned
drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad of that. I should hate to find some real
reason for the existence of your plutocratic bunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you make me tired!” said Stacey wearily. “You talk
like a child. At heart you have a kind of idea that the
people I know are different from you. You resent it, but
you have a secret feeling that they’re superior—Olympians.
That’s because—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this point in his attack the telephone bell rang and
he lifted the receiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you, Stacey?” said his father’s voice, and Stacey
knew at once that the attempt had failed. “I saw Colin
Jeffries about that matter, had a long talk with him. But I
couldn’t budge him. Said he’d do anything else in the world
for me, but that in the matter of this strike he couldn’t even
hear of a compromise. Said he’d be going back on every
principle he had if he did. That it had come to a show-down.
Was business to be run as an efficient competitive
proposition with moderate financial reward, or was it to
become a charitable institution with the investors as donators?
He made a strong case for his stand—unanswerable
logically. All the same .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve heard those statistics from Edwards and I’ve
seen some of the men. It’s not just that they should have
to live like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did Jeffries say when you pointed that out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Said he was sorry for the men and their wives, very, but
that he had to think of the stock-holders also. That they,
too, were men and women, though you couldn’t get an
employee to see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neat point,” Stacey remarked. “Jeffries owns two-thirds
of the common himself. I’ve seen the list of the
other stock-holders. There <span class='it'>is</span> one widow among them.
I’d be willing to defray her losses myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, son.” (Mr. Carroll’s voice was regretful.)
“I’d like to have got this through for you—and because I
think it’s right, though of course my convictions on the
labor and capital situation in general remain unchanged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I did what I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, dad,” said Stacey. “Edwards will know that
too. Thanks, just as much as if you’d brought it off. Good-bye.
See you at dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hung up the receiver, then looked across at Edwards.
“Nothing doing,” he said, his face impassive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards’ face had flushed a dull crimson, and his jaw
was set, so that there was an effect of massive squareness
about his head. His eyes glowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he replied thickly, “so I judged. Bombs, Carroll,
nice little hand-grenades,—that’s what’s wanted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree,” said Stacey coolly. “It would be a pleasure to
toss one at Jeffries; but that’s no use. Never was. The
reaction swings you back to below where you started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re so damned cold-blooded about it!” Edwards cried
furiously. “Can’t you put yourself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up!” said Stacey harshly. “I’m twice as angry as
you are—and I’m going to take a hand in this somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, in truth, an observer studying the two men carefully
would have ended by believing Stacey the more dangerous.
With only a little extra tautness in the muscles of
his face to alter his appearance, there was yet something
hard and ruthless in his expression. It was quite clear that
if, as Stacey had learned, nothing of his fanciful, fastidious,
early self had really vanished, neither had anything vanished
of that embittered, stony, cold-and-passionate self he had
brought back from the war. This morning while he was
at work his thoughts about the strike and about Mr. Carroll’s
undertaking had been haphazard, interrupted by warm
memories of the scene at home the night before. Now
Stacey’s whole mind was concentrated in a kind of chilly
fierceness on the single problem of how he could force Colin
Jeffries to yield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s got to be personal fighting—no principles; they’re no
good,” he thought. “Now what handle have I got? What
do I know about Jeffries?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In response to this way of putting it, a casual winter-night’s
memory flashed into his mind. Of course! He
threw up his head and laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got a sort of half-idea, Edwards,” he observed.
“Maybe it will work out. Now you run along and let me
think it over. See you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey sat there, reflecting intensely, for perhaps a quarter
of an hour. Then he got up, went out, and walked over to
the building in which Colin Jeffries had his office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The millionaire’s large outer-office was full of men waiting.
They sat singly or in groups and talked in low tones.
Some of them, men prominent in one business or another,
Stacey recognized and nodded to. He gave his card to a
young man—some sort of secretary, probably—who promised
to take it in to Mr. Jeffries but said he feared there
wasn’t the slightest chance of seeing him this afternoon
except by appointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the card in, anyway,” Stacey remarked, and
sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Less than ten minutes later the secretary returned, obviously
impressed, to say that Mr. Jeffries would see Mr.
Carroll now; then conducted him to the financier’s private
office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, Stacey,” said Mr. Jeffries cordially, getting up
to shake hands. “Sit down, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Stacey, and did so, across the table from
the millionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This being called by his first name amused him. It must
be meant as a kingly compliment by Mr. Jeffries, since he
and Stacey had not met above half a dozen times—or perhaps
it was to aid in the effect of cordiality. But there
were many other things besides amusement in Stacey’s mind.
He was thinking swiftly, taking stock of his adversary, all
in the brief interval while he accepted and lighted a courteously
proferred cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This cordiality now,—it was not a warmth radiating
from inner good will; it was external, a fire built on snow.
He felt the man as cold—perhaps cruel, too. If so, cold
even in his cruelty. Stacey felt aversion, something in that
personality was rasping to him; but he was far from feeling
contempt. He recognized that he was encountering a strong
and steely character, not one—like most—only apparently
strong. Not a touch here of the business-man as shown in
romances or movies, no nervous movement of papers, no
abstracted air of meditation on vast enterprises. Mr. Jeffries
did not even say that he could spare Stacey a few
minutes of his time; he was as leisurely as though he were
lounging at a club. Yet the man was intensely busy from
morning to night, and at this moment his outer-office was
crowded with those waiting to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was about the street-railway strikers that I wanted to
speak to you, Mr. Jeffries,” said Stacey, blowing out his
match. (There had only been that much of a pause.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of regret came over the millionaire’s face. “I’m
sorry, Stacey,” he replied, shaking his head slowly, “but
there’s nothing I can do. I explained my position to your
father this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know you did,” Stacey continued carefully. “But
you and he are so much alike” (they were alike superficially;
Stacey disclaimed almost passionately that there was
any deep likeness) “that I feel sure you must both see this
trouble as a matter of principle, as labor versus capital, as a
strike,—not as men striking. The men can’t live on the
wages you’re offering to pay them, Mr. Jeffries. Can’t—live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the company can’t live and give them any better
ones,” returned Mr. Jeffries quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey did not express his opinion of the company’s right
to life. He attended quietly to what Mr. Jeffries said. All
this was no use, anyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s more in this than you see, Stacey. It’s a test
case—an unfortunate one, I grant you; test cases are rarely
the ones a man would choose. It’s come to a question of
whether business organized on private capital can exist at
all. If it can’t we’d better know it at once; if it can then it
will have to be run on the basis of a decent adjustment
between receipts and disbursements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, quite unmoved by this, shook his head. “I don’t
see how this can be a test case,” he observed. “Suppose
you win,—it’s a paper victory only. Neither these men nor
any others can work for you permanently at a wage that
won’t support them and their families. Know what I
think?” he demanded, gazing sharply at the older man, “I
rather think the whole thing’s a threat held over the head of
the city council.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jeffries laughed. “That’s shrewd of you, Stacey,”
he remarked. “But, if so, you’ll admit it’s not very
successful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, wary because of the note of flattery, continued to
gaze at him. How keen the man was! Not once had he
said: “You young men who’ve come back with socialistic
ideas .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He had met Stacey with apparent candor and
with no touch of tolerant superiority. His manner
proclaimed equality,—but perhaps just faintly over-proclaimed
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t even consider yielding,” Stacey asked, “so
that these men can support their families—now—in winter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, my boy. It’s to your credit, though, that you
take the thing so much to heart. I admire you for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “my boy” and the admiration were under the circumstances
a little too much for Stacey. The muscles of
his face hardened almost imperceptibly, and he leaned back
in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Mr. Jeffries, I’ve got to fight you,” he said coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other’s expression did not alter, no glint of amusement
shone in his eyes; but he considered Stacey intently.
“I’m sorry for that,” he returned after a moment, “but I
guess I can only say: Go to it! I know it will be a fair
fight, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Stacey, “it won’t be. I want to warn you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other’s gaze sharpened. “Well?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Jeffries,” Stacey inquired, “do you remember a
young woman named Ethel Wyatt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied the financier, his expression unchanged.
“She was governess to our children for a time. There were
reasons which made us let her go. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That last sentence was the only hint of weakness. Stacey
felt an evil exultation. However, his face was impassive.
“I was told in confidence,” he observed quietly, “that she
left of her own accord because you hid in her bathroom and
otherwise persecuted her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint color showed on Mr. Jeffries’ high cheek-bones,
and his eyes hardened until they became like polished steel,
but when he spoke his tone was quiet and firm, as before.
Stacey reluctantly admired him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not a pretty story,” he said. “I shan’t even
trouble to deny it. May I ask why you repeat it to
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I intend to use it against you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jeffries considered him fixedly. “That <span class='it'>seemed</span> to be
what you were driving at. I could hardly believe that I
understood your meaning correctly. We’ll waive all the
moral aspects of such blackmail—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let’s!” said Stacey calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jeffries frowned at the insolence of the interruption.
Only from a certain tautness in his face could Stacey perceive
that he was very angry, so well did he keep himself
under control. “Do you really fancy,” he demanded, his
words like sharp staccato taps of a hammer, “that any one,
any one of any account, in this city is going to believe such
a story?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not officially, of course,” Stacey replied. “Being the
power you are, Mr. Jeffries, you could go out in the street
and commit publicly almost any crime short of murder, and
officially even the witnesses wouldn’t admit that you’d done
it. But privately most people will love to believe such a
story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do <span class='it'>you</span> believe it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Stacey indifferently, “or I wouldn’t use it.
But, to tell you the truth, I haven’t the slightest interest in
the story. It doesn’t even amuse me. I merely see it as a
possible weapon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jeffries continued to gaze at him sharply. “Do you
know anything about this young woman, Ethel Wyatt?”
he inquired presently, his voice frigid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was wary. “A little,” he returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you doubtless know the sort of person she has
proved to be. She has been the mistress of Ames Price,
among others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would take the word of a harlot in the matter of
this libellous—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” Stacey exclaimed scornfully, “let’s not go in for
rhetoric! There’s no dictograph in the room. Let’s not
be benevolent millionaire and returned hero deserving well
of his country!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well!” snapped Mr. Jeffries, his cheeks slightly
flushed. “You’d take this girl’s word against mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jeffries said nothing for a moment, merely regarding
Stacey intently. “How you do dislike me, don’t you?” he
asked then. He had quite recovered his calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey raised his eyebrows. “That has nothing to do
with it,” he remarked coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t it? You can say that and still be ready to smirch
my good name and make my wife miserable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey drew himself up. “What’s a man’s smirched name
or a weeping wife compared with a man who’s under-nourished
and a wife who can’t buy proper clothes for her
children?” he demanded bitterly. “It’s useless! You <span class='it'>can’t</span>
see why I’m doing this thing. For you I must have some
other motive. Well, I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re going to use this story unless I give in on the
strike—is that the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I don’t say I’m going to throw it around broad-cast.
Perhaps. I shall anyway tell it to my father. If you
are a man and not just a popular legend, that ought to hit
you almost as hard as the other thing. Because if I were
you and had a friend like my father, I should want to
keep him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time Mr. Jeffries withdrew his eyes from his
enemy and looked away, frowning. “You’ll hurt him a good
deal,” he said quietly. “When are you going to tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow morning. I won’t spoil his evening, anyway.”
Stacey got up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute!” said the older man sharply. “I suppose
you understand that you force me to play the same kind of
game. I shall of course endeavor to learn where—and how—you
have known this girl, since I’ve no doubt you got the
story direct from her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I should,” said Stacey indifferently. “It might
prove discreditable. Also I should fancy that what I am
doing is a criminal offence. I am really sorry for one
thing,—to have taken up so much of your time,” he added
sincerely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jeffries considered him grimly. “You have peculiar
compunctions,” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey went back to work. He was not particularly satisfied
with the interview and he felt rather soiled mentally.
The threat of the story, not the story itself, was what he
had wanted to use. Once set going, the story would only be
punishment, and he was not at all interested in punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that evening during dinner Mr. Carroll was called
to the ’phone, and when he returned he was jubilant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good news, Stacey!” he cried, slapping his son on the
back. “Colin Jeffries has come around. Said you came up
to see him and repeated the things I’d said, told him how
strongly I felt about it (why didn’t you tell me?), and afterward
he got to thinking things over till at last he said:
‘To hell with principles! It’s been my experience that if
Edward Carroll wants a thing done the thing must be right.’
The strike’s off. It’ll be in the papers to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll settled himself again in his chair and beamed.
As for Catherine, she uttered a cry of joy, then suddenly
looked across at Stacey. But he avoided her eyes. However,
though he felt smirched, he also felt a fierce exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll leaned back in his chair. “Another thing
Colin said, Stacey,” he remarked proudly, “was that you
were wasted on a job like architecture, that you had—let’s
see!—a concentrated directness of purpose that would have
got you most anywhere in business. I was to be sure to
tell you that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey had looked up at this, startled. By Jove! the man
was a good sport! Stacey was filled with admiration, and
it struck him that he had been making Edwards’ mistake,
had been seeing Colin Jeffries as a symbol, not just as an
individual. Always this haze of legend hanging about everything!
You had to tear it off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, when he had gone upstairs to bed, he fell to meditating
on the whole affair. How incongruously people and
things were tangled! The great street-railway strike had
come to an abrupt end because a year ago he, Stacey Carroll,
had run off to a disreputable road-house with a strange
reckless girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire front page of the paper next morning was
occupied by Mr. Jeffries’ statement. It was a masterpiece.
It began by recapitulating the facts—the doubled and tripled
cost of material, the city council’s refusal to allow a ten-cent
fare, the company’s dilemma,—to the accompaniment
of persuasive figures. The <span class='it'>beau geste</span> that followed was
all the more effective for their convincingness. There were
other things than gain in this world. There were human
beings. We were our brothers’ keepers. (Stacey thought of
Edwards’ remark, and grinned.) We owed them a right
to a decent existence even at the cost of sacrifice to ourselves.
A corporation was not a soulless machine. It had
not, save in theory, any existence of its own. (Stacey
nodded approval. Good point!) It was simply a group of
individuals banded together, in accordance with the law,
for the prosecution of a legitimate business and for the
public service. The Vernon Street-Railway Company was
such a group; and the members of this group now, after a
careful investigation of conditions, made by themselves and
by disinterested friends (here complimentary mention was
made of Mr. Carroll’s generous initiative), felt that they
could not at present, with harsh winter already here, require
their employees to live on a reduced wage. This decision
was taken though it meant not even a nominal profit but a
considerable monthly deficit for the company. Every effort
at retrenchment would be made. Economy would be rigid.
The service might fall off slightly, but the public were
prayed to be lenient, remembering that the company was
failing in its business duty in order to accomplish a larger
human duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were also editorials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey felt no disdain,—only amusement and admiration.
Mr. Jeffries’ telephoned message of last evening had revealed
the man as not afraid to face the truth squarely.
He might live in an atmosphere of magniloquent lies; that
was because they served his purpose. At least, he was not
himself deceived by them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards was waiting for Stacey at the office. “By the
Lord!” he cried, waving the paper in one hand and wringing
Stacey’s hand with the other, “you did it! Damned if you
didn’t! Now tell me: <span class='it'>what</span> did you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I just emphasized the things father had already
said and pointed out how much my father’s loyalty to Jeffries
meant,” said Stacey innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards stared at him. “The hell you did!” he exclaimed.
“Carroll, you did some sort of dirty work—awfully
dirty work, I’ll bet!” And he grinned with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now look here, Edwards,” said Stacey soberly, “if you
ever suggest that to any one else, or if you even let on that
I had anything to do in this business at all, you’ll make
things awfully unpleasant for me. Honestly! That’s all
I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I won’t, then. You can take my word for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” said Stacey, dropping into a chair and lighting
a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t. Can’t possibly. I’ve got to get to work. Precious
little I’ve done these last days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, Edwards lingered. His jubilant mood had
passed now, and he looked at Stacey with a kind of awkward
wistfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Carroll!” he blurted out finally, “you remember
that night of the Legion meeting a year and more ago?”
Stacey nodded. “Well, then I felt the better man of us two—no,
I don’t mean better—saner, perhaps. You were”—he
puzzled—“sort of twisted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“Twisted,” thought Stacey. Again that word.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards continued after a moment, but with a shyness
that in his rough rugged personality was appealing. “Now
you’ve—got something, some solution for things. I don’t
know what it is exactly, but there’s something. I just
wanted you to know that I recognized it—that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s awfully decent of you,” returned Stacey quietly,
“but I don’t think I’ve got anything really—any solution, I
mean. Perhaps less than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edwards shook his head. “Tell you what I think it is,”
he observed. “You’ve come to see people as on a wrong
track—struggling hard for things that don’t count, food and
clothes more than they need, automobiles, fine houses, all
things of existence that don’t get them anywhere,—totally
without desire for life. That’s an easy enough point of
view to take intellectually, but you <span class='it'>feel</span> it, really live it yourself.
You live in a palace, but you’d as soon live in a hut.
Because <span class='it'>you</span> don’t care any more for those futile things.
Except,” he added, “when they’re the bare essentials—as in
this strike. Then you turn hard as flint in your will to get
them—for other people. Thanks, you know. Thanks awfully!
’Bye!” He stumped out, waving his hand as though
to ward off an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey was touched. Edwards was an idealist, for all his
rude indomitable spirit and his contact with the rough working
world; Stacey knew that. Yet it was pleasant to have a
friend who thought better of you than you deserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one corollary to the strike. Four days later a
grateful city council voted to allow a flat ten-cent fare. So
now every one was satisfied—except the public, who had
exactly what they merited, Stacey thought. He laughed
heartily, wondering a little whether Colin Jeffries had not
all along counted on this possibility.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Christmas a year ago had been a ghastly festival for
Stacey, that he had gone through with somehow, his face
stiffened into a fixed smile, his voice saying mechanical
things, while within him only one emotion had been alive—the
fierce, dizzy, dangerous craving to get away, from this,
from everything and every one. And it could not have been
much gayer for the others. Mr. Carroll had watched his
son apprehensively, Jimmy Prout, too, had fallen below his
customary debonair form, and even Julie, who, though more
intelligent than people gave her credit for being, was not
subtle, had a grave anxious air. Also the thought of Phil’s
recent death and of Catherine grieving in that lonely squalid
house hung over all of them. Only Junior had been quite
himself. He had in truth been the life of the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christmas this year was very different—Christmas Eve,
especially. There was not quite the old exuberance; that
could never return in this grayer sadder world,—or perhaps
it was merely that Julie and Stacey and Jimmie were
grown-up now. But there was a genial friendly warmth in
the atmosphere. And then there were three children this
year. They chattered and laughed and stamped impatiently
in the long hall that led from the library to the big drawing-room
where the tree was being prepared, and when at
last the drawing-room doors were thrown open and the
brilliant tree was displayed all three gave a howl of joy
that would have satisfied even Dickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll was extraordinarily good on such occasions.
He delivered the presents—not too slowly, not too rapidly—from
the great pile about the base of the tree, with a pleasant
easy grace and sometimes a little speech. His own gifts
he laid aside in a corner, to open later. They made an
imposing heap, too; for many people outside of the family
delighted to remember Mr. Carroll. Women, especially.
He had great success with women and remained quite unspoiled
by it, accepting it with apparent unconsciousness, or
as a matter of course, as an aristocrat accepts his position.
Old wives of old friends, young wives of friends’ sons,
daughters of friends, spinsters to whom he had been kind,—he
stirred all of them to liking. Perhaps it was Mr. Carroll’s
good looks or his grace of manner or his goodness of
heart or his youthful spirit or all of them together—Stacey
did not know; but he recognized his father’s fascination
and looked with affectionate amusement at the growing
pile of prettily wrapped gifts. But it did not occur to
Stacey that he himself had inherited that attractiveness to
women; for he had inherited the unconsciousness of it
along with the trait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three boys were making a tremendous racket, Julie
was flushed and talkative, Jimmy Prout, a colored paper cap
on his good-looking head, was lolling easily in his chair and
drawing discordant wails from a toy accordion. Only
Catherine seemed subdued. She sat near Julie, whom she
liked warmly, and smiled and spoke quietly at times, but
there was a faint tremulousness about her lips and a sensitiveness,
as to pain, in the look of her eyes, that Stacey, who
caught quickly the slightest change in Catherine, perceived
clearly. Perhaps it was her shyness in all this confusion.
Stacey did not know. She had not seemed quite herself
of late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party broke up finally. Julie took her husband and
her delirious son home, and Mr. Carroll and Stacey were
left with Catherine and her two boys. Jackie, exhausted
with happiness, sat on his mother’s lap and played sleepily
with a mechanical mouse; Carter leaned against Stacey’s
knee; Mr. Carroll sat, relaxed, in a chair near his gifts,
which he showed no eagerness to open. The tree was lifeless,
all its little colored candles extinguished, and the floor
was strewn with ribbon and tissue-paper. The room held
the quiet sadness that broods over a festival that is finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine spoke first, setting Jackie on his feet and rising.
“Thank you, Mr. Carroll, for everything,” she murmured.
“I cannot—express how good you have been. And you,
Stacey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men had risen, too. “Why, my dear girl,” Mr. Carroll
returned, “you’ve given us far more happiness than
we you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “I must take the boys up now,” she
said. “I’ve promised, as it’s Christmas Eve, to stay with
them just for once while they undress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll come back, Catherine?” Stacey asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she replied, without looking at him, “I’ll
come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir,” said Stacey gaily, when he was left with his
father, “aren’t you going to open all those bundles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presently! Presently!” Mr. Carroll replied. “I’ll carry
them up to my study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say!” Stacey protested, “I want to see what
you’ve got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father shook his head. “There’s something better
than that waiting for us,” he remarked, with a smile. “In
the dining-room. A bottle of Pol Roger and some sandwiches
and so forth. Come along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, rather!” Stacey exclaimed. “What a happy
thought! I’m starved, too,—to say nothing of my thirst.
You never eat anything at dinner in the excitement of this
sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered a bit that his father had not suggested their
waiting for Catherine, then understood suddenly that this
was a handsome tribute to himself, an effort to express
wordlessly that they two, father and son, were close friends
who needed no one else to help them achieve intimacy. But
the first thing Mr. Carroll did was to prepare carefully and
set aside a plate of good things to eat. “For Catherine,” he
explained. Then, with a boyish smile at Stacey, he took
the bottle from the cooler, uncorked it, and poured the hissing
pale-gold wine into the delicate flaring glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you ashamed to violate the laws of your country
in this way?” asked Stacey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not doing that,” Mr. Carroll returned. “When it
comes to whiskey I do some considerable violating, but
this champagne has been in my cellar for years. To your
health, son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To yours, sir!” Stacey replied cordially. They touched
glasses and drank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked, like the good friends they were, in an easy
desultory way while they sipped the wine and ate a little.
But all at once Mr. Carroll became silent, then suddenly
looked across at his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stacey,” he said, “don’t be a fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an odd speech, but the oddest thing about it was the
tone, which was not rough like the words, but pleading,
almost cajoling. Mr. Carroll might have been saying: “Do
me a favor, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey grinned. “Try not to,” he said. “Explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his father was filling Stacey’s glass, and, when he had
finished doing this, took more time than seemed necessary
to replace the bottle in the cooler and adjust the napkin
about its neck. And even then he did not reply at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said at last, with an obvious effort, and not
looking at his son, “I mean to say—why the devil don’t you
ask Catherine to marry you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, who had lifted his glass, started so that some of
the yellow liquid spilled over upon the table-cloth. He
leaned back in his chair, amazed and shocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sir, I—” he stammered, then broke off helplessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where will you find any one who’s shown herself as
good and sweet and courageous?” Mr. Carroll went on,
almost belligerently, as though Catherine’s merits were
in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nowhere,” Stacey replied soberly. It was abhorrent to
him to see his deepest emotion, which he hardly admitted
even to himself, spilled over the table, like the wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is—Phil,” Stacey muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phil is dead,” Mr. Carroll answered gravely. “We have
all felt his loss. He was a noble character. And you were
his closest friend—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just for that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just for that he would trust Catherine to you gladly.
It would not be he to stand between you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Stacey said in a stifled voice, “I suppose not. It is
not Phil, but— Please, sir!” he begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father nodded. “Pretty cheeky of me, I admit, son,”
he said gruffly. “Wouldn’t blame you if you’d grown angry,
but you understand how I mean it—er—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, dad. I know,” Stacey replied quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They finished their supper in an awkward silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Carroll, rising, “I suppose I’d better get
those presents of mine and open them. There’ll be a lot
of notes to write in reply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey followed him back to the littered drawing-room,
mechanically almost, because he did not know what else to
do. “Want any help, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks,” said his father, his arms full of bundles.
“I’ll be down again after a while.” And he went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, left alone, stared after him, then walked restlessly
down the hall to the library. It was painful to him that his
father should have divined his feelings. But this was not
the worst. The worst was that, if his father had understood
him, so, assuredly, had Catherine. This grieved
Stacey deeply. He had been so careful, he thought; he had
never meant to let her see what he felt for her. But she did
know. Of course she knew! How stupid he had been!
No wonder he found her changed! He could see it all now.
His father, it seemed, believed that Catherine could care
for Stacey as he for her; but Stacey knew better. She was
shocked and saddened by her discovery, uncertain what to
do—whether to go away or not, generously anxious not to
give pain, all her peace of mind gone. Poor Catherine!
Stacey was furious with himself. But this did no good—not
the least bit. He shook off his anger impatiently. What
was to be done about it? That was the point. How without
putting things into words—which always made them
worse—was he to let Catherine know that she could count
on him, that he would be merely the friend she wanted him
to be? He was puzzling over it when she entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked startled when she saw that he was there
alone, and paused just inside the door as though half inclined
to retreat. It hurt Stacey keenly that she should be
afraid of him—and with reason. He had risen and
stood facing her, but across the room from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you—come in?” he asked. “Or would you rather
go somewhere else—the dining-room? There’s luncheon
ready for you in there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “No,” she answered, “and I’m not
hungry.” But she did not come farther into the room, and,
though she smiled waveringly, Stacey saw the expression of
pain—or perhaps fear—in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catherine,” he began in a low voice, after a moment,
“why is it so hard—and dangerous—to be frank?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ought it to be either?” she replied gently. She looked at
him steadily as she spoke, but the expression on her face
was odd and troubled. There was compassion in it,
though; he felt that strongly. Of course! A generous
emotion would always be dominant in Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came a little nearer to her. “Catherine,” he said, “I
have not meant ever to—” then broke off. It was worse to
say things than to leave them unspoken, and she would understand
them anyway. He tried desperately to call the
whole subject off. “Oh,” he remarked, with a positively
sepulchral gaiety, “Christmas is too emotional! We’re good
friends, aren’t we? and that’s all that matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she continued to gaze at him in that same odd manner.
The very pose of her body made her seem like a creature
at bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly Stacey’s thoughts were swept away like so
much rubbish by a wave of sure emotion. He took a step
toward Catherine, stretching out his hands impulsively, and
all at once she was in his arms, trembling and weeping, her
lips raised to his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Stacey, didn’t you know I loved you?” she murmured
presently. “Your father knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wh-when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since the evening you quarreled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” Stacey cried, “was it—for love that you defended
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—might call it that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew a little away from him now and made him sit
down beside her on the divan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” she said gently, holding his hand against her
cheek, “that men can hardly ever think in facts; they must
think in patterns; and anything that will not fit into a pattern
they find wrong. But I <span class='it'>want</span> to tell you the truth. I
have always loved you, Stacey, always! It was not disloyalty.
I am sure Phil knew. I loved you <span class='it'>and</span> him. It was
different. I <span class='it'>can’t</span> make you understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey, very shaken and confused, and not understanding
anything save (humbly) that this was giving on a scale beyond
what was credible, drew her to him and kissed her
hot face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Stacey,” she murmured, “I feel so—immodest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha!” he interrupted, laughing unsteadily, “now who’s
thinking not like an individual but like the whole female
sex?” And at this she, too, laughed a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat there, close together, scarcely speaking. But it
came over Stacey in a rush that in his love for Catherine
there was a touch of what he had felt for Marian and something
more—far more! Truth, fact. It was complete.
This was reality. There was nothing left out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catherine,” he cried, “you are not only a grown woman;
you are a little girl, too. And so I’m not afraid of you any
longer—I always was, a little, you know. Now I’m not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s odd,” she said shyly, “because I—have also been
afraid of you, a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But really? On account of my temper, I suppose.
You’re right. I’ve a rotten temper,” he said remorsefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled. “No, not on account of your temper. I
think,” she explained, grave now, “it was the—the serenity
you have achieved, Stacey dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew away to stare at her, but before he could speak
the door of the room opened and Mr. Carroll entered, then
paused abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine saw him first and hurried to his side, clasping
his hand in both of hers and laying her head against his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carroll reached out his other hand to grasp Stacey’s
and gazed at his son with shining eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Carroll, do you mind?” Catherine cried softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind, my dear!” he replied. “Isn’t it exactly what I’ve
hoped for?” And he bent over and kissed her cheek, then
made her sit down beside him on the divan, while Stacey
stood a little way off, looking at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Er—where are you thinking of living?” Mr. Carroll
asked presently in a carefully matter-of-fact voice, while he
slowly clipped off the end of a cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stacey flashed a swift questioning glance at Catherine.
“Why,” he remarked then deliberately, “what with the
scarcity of houses and all, we were rather thinking of staying
on here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Carroll, “if you will, you will, I suppose.”
But he had paused to light his cigar before speaking,
and it had taken him rather longer than usual.</p>
